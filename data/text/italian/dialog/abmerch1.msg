{100}{}{Vedi un mercante.}
{102}{}{Vedi un mercante che sta cercando di riparare la pompa dell'acqua.}
{103}{}{Non riesco proprio a far funzionare questa cosa!}
{104}{}{Sembra davvero difficile da riparare.}
{105}{}{Che pezzo di merda!}
{106}{}{Stubborn little sonnuva bitch are we?}
{107}{}{Potresti darmi una mano?}
{108}{}{Forse tu avrai piu' fortuna con questa.}
{109}{}{Ehi, grazie per aver riparato la pompa dell'acqua!}
{110}{}{You should notify the headmonk that the waterpump is now fixed.}
{200}{}{Grazie per averci aiutato con questa cosa.}
{300}{}{Ah, what a piece of shi- umm, I'm a little busy right now. Do you need something or are
 you just wasting my time?}
{301}{}{Actually yes, the Abbot sent me. He said the water pump is having some trouble.}
{302}{}{Heh, "having trouble" is an understatement. This ol' thing is totally busted. There's no way
 it's going to run again.}
{303}{}{Capisco. Allora immagino che non farebbe male se dessi un'occhiata.}
{304}{}{Sure, be my guest. Not like you could break it any more.}
{305}{}{Non voglio disturbare, ma qual e' il problema qui?}
{306}{}{The main water pump for the Abbey is busted. The damn thing was breathing its last the past few days
 and now it's finally gone out.}
{307}{}{I'm a bit of a techie, mind if I take a look?}
{308}{}{Well, I'm not that great with machines, but perhaps I can see if something can be done.}
{309}{}{Certo, nessuno te lo impedisce.}
{310}{}{Uh, scusa. Arrivederci.}
{311}{}{Vedro' di fare il possibile.}
{312}{}{I thought I might be able to help, but if you want to be an asshole about it, then you're welcome to figure it out on your own.}
{313}{}{I told the Abbot I'd be willing to help, but if you want to be an asshole about it, then you're welcome to figure it out on your own.}
{320}{}{[He squints at you for a moment, then slowly lets out his breath in a sigh.] Sorry friend, this thing's being a
 real bitch, and it's gotten me all worked up. I didn't mean to snap at ya. }
{321}{}{Beh, qual e' il problema allora?}
{322}{}{Vabbe', ciao.}
{330}{}{Torna a trovarmi domani mattina.}
{400}{}{Oh, sei tu di nuovo. Hai avuto fortuna?}
{401}{}{No, non ancora. Ti faro' sapere se ne avro'.}
{402}{}{Actually, yes. I looked inside and it seems the motor is completely busted. The connections are shot, so we're
 going to have to get our hands on a new motor, as well as some wires to reconnect everything since the old wires are fried.}
{500}{}{Hmm... the connectors are shot on the main motor, eh? Well, I got some wires here with me that will work, but not
 that specific motor. I am sure Vault City has the part though. Go there and speak with Harry in the main courtyard. Tell him
 Dave sent you. Damn motor is expensive, but he should give you a good deal.}
{501}{}{Ci vado subito. Torno presto.}
{502}{}{Whoa, hold on a second. I was happy to help you figure out the problem, but who said I'm willing to trek across
 the wastes to go buy you an expensive motor? If you want my help, it's going to cost you.}
{503}{}{How 'bout *you* tell Harry that when you go fetch it your damn self? I'm not your fucking errand boy. Bye.}
{510}{}{Alright, I wouldn't expect someone to do work for free. The part will cost you bout 500 and I think 100 more for
 your trouble is reasonable. Here's 600.}
{511}{}{Meglio cosi'. Tornero' con il pezzo.}
{600}{}{Any luck on that part? This machine won't fix itself.}
{601}{}{No, non ancora. Tornero' quando l'avro'.}
{602}{}{Si', ho il pezzo proprio qui.}
{700}{}{Excellent. Want me to install the damn thing, or do you want the pleasure?}
{701}{}{Penso di farcela. Fatti da parte.}
{702}{}{Actually, I think I've done enough on this job. Go ahead and install it yourself.}
{800}{}{Va bene, consegnalo.}
{801}{}{Ecco qua.}
{900}{}{That should do it.}
{901}{}{The water pump has been repaired.}
{910}{}{(Wipes the sweat from his forehead.) Yeah, need something?}
{911}{}{The Abbot said you might need some assistance. What seems to be the trouble?}
{912}{}{Non importa. Arrivederci.}
{913}{}{I took a look at the water pump and it seems the motor is completely busted. The connections are shot, so we're
 going to have to get our hands on a new motor, as well as some wires to reconnect everything since the old wires are fried.}
