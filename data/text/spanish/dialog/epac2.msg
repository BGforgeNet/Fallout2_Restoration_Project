{100}{}{Ves un Holograma.}
{101}{}{Ves al Director de Ciencias.}
{102}{}{Holograma 00000. El se ocupa de los aspectos científicos de la APA.}

{211}{}{Lo siento, no te entiendo. Adiós.}
{212}{}{Interesante. Parece que solamente puedes comunicarte usando numeros binarios. Espera,
si escribo lo que dices, tal vez pueda encontrarle la vuelta a esto.}
{220}{}{[Despues de un par de horas, finalmente crees que has logrado traducir correctamente los números binarios. Parece que dice "¡Ayudame! Cortocircuito."]}
{221}{}{Bueno, eso fue divertido de decodificar. Nos vemos.}
{222}{}{Un corte eléctrico en el rollo de cinta, eh? De acuerdo,veamos si podemos arreglarte.}
{230}{}{01001000 01100101 01101100 01110000 00100000 01101101 01100101 00100001}
{231}{}{Sólo checkeaba. Nos vemos.}
{232}{}{Don't worry, I'm working on getting you fixed.}
{240}{}{01010010 01100101 01100010 01101111 01101111 01110100 00100000 01101101 01100101 00100001}
{241}{}{Alright, I give up. Sorry.}
{242}{}{¿Sigue sin funcionar? Espera, déjame descifrar eso.}
{250}{}{[Eres capaz de decodificar el mensaje mucho más rápido esta vez: "¡Reinicia!"] Oh, por supuesto. [Reinicias la máquina ejecutando el holograma. Para matar el tiempo, silbas mientras suenan todos sus procedimientos de inicio.]}
{251}{}{[Continuar.]}
{260}{}{By Hawking, you've done it! My vocal program had been stuck in binary mode for *years*. It's been so long since
 I've had the pleasure of exchanging dialogue with a fellow intellect. You'd think during all this time *one* of my
 comrades would have had the decency to learn binary, but nooo.}
{261}{}{No prob--}
{270}{}{They didn't have time for me, you see. Oh no, they were too *busy* indulging in their bureaucratic nonsense.
 Too busy imposing regulations upon one another and bickering like fools. And look where it got them: stuck in an endless
 loop in the conference chamber. Ha! Serves 'em right.}
{271}{}{Stuck in a loop?}
{272}{}{I actually fixed that problem. No more endless loops.}
{280}{}{What's that? Oh, yes, yes, it seems a malfunction somewhere has generated a powerful magnetic field, which is
 erasing their short term memory every couple minutes, damning them to a kind of hologram purgatory. But never mind that,
 we're better off without them. With them tied up in an endless argument, that leaves me, er, I mean, *us*, in charge of
 the facility. With my supreme intellect, and your physical body, we could make quite the duo.}
{281}{}{First off, why don't you tell me what exactly this place is?}
{290}{}{Really? In my opinion, we're better off without them, but if you thought otherwise who am I to complain. With my
 supreme intellect, and your physical body, we could make quite the duo, you know.}
{291}{}{First off, why don't you tell me what exactly this place is?}
{300}{}{Why, it's the Environmental Protection Agency, of course. This is a federal facility originally established to
 regulate chemicals and ensure the protection of the environment, but it's become oh so much more than that! Why, you're
 standing in one of the nation's top experimental research facilities. We have so many exciting things in development. Of
 course, progress has been a bit slow lately, what with the fall of civilization and all...}
{301}{}{Eso es comprensible.}
{302}{}{El apocalipsis no es excusa para ser holgazanear}
{310}{}{Yes, if only I had an able bodied assistant, I could finally make some more progress on my research...}
{311}{}{¿Qué clase de ayuda necesitas?}
{320}{}{Well, that depends. I don't suppose you'd feel comfortable wielding a large experimental gun, would you?}
{321}{}{Hell yeah I would!}
{322}{}{Claro.}
{323}{}{Creo que voy a pasar.}
{330}{}{Oh, I see. That's too bad. Oh well, no hard feelings. I'll just wait until the next flesh and blood person comes
 wandering into this facility. It's bound to happen again within a century or two. Goodbye.}
{340}{}{Hola de nuevo. No tengo que suponer que haz reconsiderado mi oferta para ayudarme a Probar la arma experimental?}
{341}{}{No. Lo siento.}
{342}{}{De acuerdo. Por supuesto.}
{350}{}{Excellent! You're the perfect candidate. You see, in an effort to help the military become more "environmentally
 friendly", I developed a new weapon that requires no ammo, as it runs completely on *light*. I call it, the
 *Solar Scorcher*. However, it's yet to be tested under direct sunlight, which is, of course, where you come in.}
{351}{}{So you just want me to go outside and shoot this thing? That's it?}
{352}{}{Yeah, yeah, just give me the gun already.}
{360}{}{Essentially, yes. Of course, I need to know how well it fares in a combat situation, so I'd appreciate it if you
 could find some threatening life forms out there, which you could then spectacularly dispatch with my Solar Scorcher.}
{361}{}{Go outside and kill something, got it. So, where is this Solar Scorcher?}
{370}{}{Not so hasty, my friend. I don't want you to simply shoot the weapon outside aimlessly. I need to know how well
 it fares in a combat situation, so I'd appreciate it if you could find some threatening life forms out there, which you
 could then spectacularly dispatch with my Solar Scorcher.}
{371}{}{Go outside and kill something, got it. So, where is this Solar Scorcher?}
{380}{}{Oh, yes, it's in that locker on the wall over there, next to my projector. The passcode is 03141879.}
{381}{}{Alright, I'll try it out and let you know how it goes.}
{390}{}{Ah, welcome back. Have you gotten a chance to test the Solar Scorcher?}
{391}{}{Sure did. It scorched the hell out of things.}
{392}{}{Sure did, but the piece of shit broke on me. I had to trash it.}
{393}{}{No, aún no.}
{394}{}{I'll get around to it.}
{400}{}{Excellent! I'm delighted to know it works as intended. Thank you for assisting me with this. Why don't you go
 ahead and keep the Solar Scorcher, I'd rather it get some use than sit around here and collect dust.}
{401}{}{¡Gracias!}
{402}{}{Bien,pero no planeo devolvertelo}
{410}{}{Oh... I see. I don't understand, that prototype withstood vigorous lab testing... [He shakes his head
 sadly.] Anyway, thanks for assisting me.}
{411}{}{Lo que sea.}
{412}{}{No hay problema.}
{420}{}{Nice to see you again. However, if you'll excuse me, I've got a plethora of projects that require my attention.}
{421}{}{[Fin.]}
{500}{}{Haz arreglado el Holograma 00000.}
{510}{}{You test the Solar Scorcher for the Director of Science.}
