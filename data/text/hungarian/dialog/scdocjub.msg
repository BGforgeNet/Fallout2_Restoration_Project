{100}{}{Egy id?sebb személyt látsz. Barátságosnak t?nik.}
{101}{}{Ez itt Jubilee doktor.}
{102}{}{Elég koros ember, hófehér szakálla van, és kissé üres a tekintete.}
{103}{}{Jubilee doktor vagyok. Mi a problémája, fiatalember?}
{104}{}{Mi a problémája, fiatalember?}
{105}{}{Én sebesült.}
{106}{}{Orvosra van szükségem.}
{107}{}{Elbújhat ezzel a kis karcolással. Inkább szedjen be valamilyen tablettát, engem meg hagyjon békén!}
{108}{}{Úristen, maga súlyosan vérzik!}
{109}{}{Nem is tudom. Nem hinném, hogy meg tudom menteni a lábát. A legjobb lenne levágni.}
{110}{}{Ugye csak viccel?}
{111}{}{Haha.}
{112}{}{Itt van hát, fiam!}
{113}{}{Újra találkozunk?}
{114}{}{Kösz doki. Válaszolhatna pár kérdésre.}
{115}{}{Viszlát!}
{116}{}{50 dollár lesz.}
{117}{}{Csak gyógyítson meg!}
{118}{}{Nem maradok itt!}
{119}{}{Maga jobban csinálja.}
{120}{}{Én menni mostan.}
{121}{}{Nem. Én sosem hazudok. El fog üszkösödni, ha nem vágom le.}
{122}{}{No way you're cutting anything off, understand?}
{123}{}{Ennyi lett volna, megyek is.}
{124}{}{Ha elüszkösödik, ne engem hibáztasson!}
{125}{}{Ez nem jótékonysági kórház. Ha nincs pénz, nem dolgozom.}
{126}{}{Mit tehetek magáért?}
{127}{}{Ne kíméljen!}
{128}{}{13-as Menedék?}
{129}{}{Tudja, hol találom a 13-as Menedéket?}
{130}{}{I heard somebody saying Mr. Westin's not well. That true? I'm worried something might happen to him. He owes me money.}
{131}{}{Sóshús azt mondta, maga ellopott t?le egy térképet. Igaz ez?}
{132}{}{Munkát keresek. Tudna segíteni?}
{133}{}{Doki, tud valamit egy bizonyos csoportról, akik a rabszolga-keresked?k ellen harcolnak?}
{134}{}{Nem kell aggódnia, fiam! Ha nem terheli túl a szervezetét, talán tovább eléldegél bármelyik?nknél. Feltéve, ha nem felejti el bevenni a gyógyszereit.}
{135}{}{Ennek örülök. Érdekelne még valami.}
{136}{}{Kösz, doki.}
{137}{}{Az a részeg disznó! Egyetlen dolgot szereztem t?le, egy "Velvet Elvii" festményt... természetesen pénz ellenében.}
{138}{}{Velvet Elvii? Láthatnám esetleg?}
{139}{}{Hát ez nem éppen térkép. Na, hadd noszogassam egy kicsit más témában!}
{140}{}{Sajna mennem kell.}
{141}{}{Ezt még senki sem említette, mióta az öreg Sóshúst idehozták. Három napig lázas volt, egész id? alatt arról mormolt, hogyan találta meg a 13-as Menedéket.}
{142}{}{Sóshús?}
{143}{}{Szóval hol is van?}
{144}{}{Hun lenni menedék?}
{145}{}{Nem tudom. Sóshús mindig mondta, hogy van róla térképe, de még sohasem látta senki.}
{146}{}{Sóshús?}
{147}{}{Kérdezni még.}
{148}{}{Ez is több, mint a semmi...}
{149}{}{Sóshús egy öreg földmér? - jobban mondva - egy részeg disznó. Westin birtokán él.}
{150}{}{Lenne még valami...}
{151}{}{Kösz a történetet.}
{152}{}{Hát, reméltem, hogy nem ingyen válok meg t?le. Legyen az ára }
{153}{}{Talán kés?bb, de még valami érdekelne...}
{154}{}{Talán kés?bb, de most mennem kell.}
{155}{}{Sóshús egy öreg földmér? - jobban mondva - egy részeg disznó. Westin birtokán él.}
{156}{}{Lenne még valami...}
{157}{}{Kösz a történetet.}
{158}{}{A legjobb lesz, ha beszél Tandival, az elnökkel. Hallottam, hogy valamiféle különleges embert keres.}
{159}{}{Lenne még valami...}
{160}{}{Köszi.}
{161}{}{Meglehet... Tudok egy csoportról, akik a rabszolga-keresked?k ellen küzdenek. Mindig ott lézengenek annál a nagy m?helynél... egy autó javításán munkálkodnak.}
{162}{}{Lenne még valami...}
{163}{}{Köszi.}
{164}{}{El a kezekkel, punk!}
{165}{}{Careful there! Just takes tiny amount to expose yourself.}
{166}{}{Tedd azt vissza! Nem gyerekjáték!}
{167}{}{Azok Mr. Westin gyógyszerei, ne nyúlj hozzájuk!}
{168}{}{Ne piszkáld azokat! Nem szeretném, ha Mr. Westin tévedésb?l a rossz gyógyszereket kapná.}
{169}{}{Ne piszkáld! Épp most mértem ki Mr. Westin adagját.}
{170}{}{Jubilee doktor vagyok. Mi a probléma, szép hölgy?}
{171}{}{Mi a probléma, szép hölgy?}
{172}{}{Hát újra itt van, hölgyem?!}
{173}{}{Nem kell aggódnia, hölgyem! Ha nem terheli túl a szervezetét, bizonyára tovább eléldegél, mint bármelyik?nk. Feltéve, ha nem felejti el bevenni a gyógyszereit.}
{174}{}{Rendben. Itt van a jussa, }
{175}{}{Kösz. Próbáltam már Sóshústól némi pénzt kicsikarni, de annak a részeg disznónak mindig üres volt a zsebe.}
{176}{}{ vagyok.}
{200}{}{Whoa there, }
{201}{}{son! }
{202}{}{missy! }
{203}{}{You can't be messing with that stuff! I just measured out Mr. Westin's dose and we wouldn't want him getting the wrong meds now. What in blazes do you think you're doing?}
{204}{}{I was just trying to get a look at those pills you have on the shelf there.}
{205}{}{Oh, don't mind me. I was just window shopping.}
{206}{}{Sorry. I've just always had this irresistible compulsion to dig around in other people's stuff that I've never been able to shake.}
{207}{}{Honestly? Not expecting you to be that observant. I guess I'm going to have to improvise.}
{210}{}{Were you, now? (Doc Jubilee regards you coolly.) I'd guess you were a mite young to be suffering from a bum ticker.}
{211}{}{And you'd be right. I'm asking for my friend Cassidy. Older fella. He's got a bad heart, and traveling the wastes is getting kind of rough on him.}
{212}{}{And I'd wish you were right. I got it from my pa. Or so they tell me.}
{213}{}{Oh, nothing like that. I'm just overbearingly inquisitive, I guess.}
{220}{}{Well, you can't. This is a private practice, not a drugstore. You might want to try Duppo's, a tetch north of here.}
{221}{}{Sounds like just what I'm looking for. Bye.}
{222}{}{I'll check 'em out. In the meantime, though, do you mind if I ask you a few things?}
{223}{}{No, I think I came to the right place. I can see you're doing good work here. I thought I might offer a donation.}
{230}{}{(The doctor blinks. He blinks again.) You should probably talk to somebody about that. Unfortunately,
 I ain't the right kind of doctor. All's you need to know about that shelf is that if you mix up or taint any of those
 prescriptions, some poor fella's liable to end up in a world of hurt, if they're still in this world at all. Best keep
 your hands to yourself.}
{231}{}{Will do, doc. But, uh, say-- I've got a buddy who could really use some of those heart pills you've got there.
 Think you'd be willing to sell me some?}
{240}{}{Awww, }
{241}{}{son, }
{242}{}{miss, }
{243}{}{I wish I could help you, but I'm not taking on any new patients right now. Council's got me on retainer. Can't sell you no pills, neither-- Councilman Westin's people are supposed to pick those ones up in }
{244}{}{ days, }
{245}{}{ day, }
{246}{}{and just ain't no way I'm going to have time to mix up another batch before then.}
{247}{}{I understand, doc. Maybe I'll find a decent pharmacist somewhere else. If it's not too much to ask, though, is there any advice you could give me on the subject? You don't find medicine like that too often.}
{248}{}{Those are the breaks, I guess. Anyway, I should be alright. I've picked up *tons* about cardamomagy from old comic books. Cut the hard chems back to twice a day, TOPS, make sure to get your exercise in short, strenuous bursts so your heart doesn't have time to act up, all kinds of good stuff.}
{250}{}{I feel for you, friend, but I'm afraid those pills are for Councilman Westin, and I ain't taking on any new patients right now so I wouldn't be able to write you up a script. Now please, don't go messing around on that shelf anymore. Those prescriptions get mixed up, someone could wind up in a pretty bad way.}
{260}{}{Let's be clear here, }
{261}{}{mister. }
{262}{}{missy. }
{263}{}{What exactly do you mean by "donation?"}
{264}{}{A charitable contribution, in furtherance of your service to the public, say... $150? You can count it out in the back room. Should only take a minute, right?}
{265}{}{Uh, actually, I think I'd better check with my accountant before I do anything rash. See you later, doc.}
{270}{}{No can do, I'm afraid. Those are for Councilman Westin. His people are due by to pick them up in }
{271}{}{ days, }
{272}{}{ day, }
{273}{}{and I'm not going to have the time to mix up another batch before then. I'm sure you can find a pharmacist with a lighter workload.}
{274}{}{I see. Well, thanks anyway.}
{280}{}{(Doc Jubilee gapes at you for a moment.) Aw, you're puttin' me on, right? You've gotta be puttin' me on. (Glances at you again, shakes head, blows out cheeks.) Hooo, boy. Either way, I wouldn't be no kind of doctor if I let you walk out of here without a few pointers, at least.}
{281}{}{Let's see... for starters, you should prob'ly stop doing... well, near to just about everything oughta cover it. No drinking, no smoking, no red meat, NO chems. Try to get a half-hour a day of MILD exercise. And take it easy. Life ain't a race, 'least not the kind where you want to be first to finish. Truth told, no one ever listens to this stuff, but at least I'll be able to rest easier tonight.}
{282}{}{More important, you need to find you a half-decent chemist and tell 'em you need set up with a regular supply of Triproxinil. Tri-prox-i-nil. Wasteland stock ain't gonna be as fancy as what I got on the shelf there, but chemically, it's all the same once you get down to brass tacks. 30 milligrams, twice a day.}
{283}{}{Now, you gotta be sure to drink plenty of water while you're on this stuff. And for criminy sakes, you stay *as far as you can* from those pecker pills like they got up in New Reno, understand? They don't play nice together. Fella takes one while he's on the other, his John Thomas ain't nearly the only part of him going stiff that day, if you follow.}
{284}{}{(To yourself) Hmm, that could work. Yeah. Maybe something in the way of a PDE-5 inhibitor compound...}
{285}{}{Oh-- And if you *do* go through one of them Reno hucksters, they might go tellin' you that this stuff'll proof your heart against just about any pusher's poison you'd care to try. I ain't gonna lie to you-- there's prob'ly some truth to that. Still don't make bein' a junkie any more glamorous. You're grown and out of britches, so I ain't gonna lecture, but there it is.}
{286}{}{Thanks a million, doc. You have no idea what a help you've been. Take care.}
{287}{}{Tri-prox-i-nil, no bo-ner-pill. Heh heh. I'll keep that in mind. See you around, doc.}
{290}{}{You think you're dealing with some shifty bartertown sawbones, }
{291}{}{son, }
{292}{}{girlie, }
{293}{}{is that it? Don't. I am a trained and accredited NCR medical professional, and that's worth a lot more than that pocketful o' chump change.}
{294}{}{My apologies. Obviously, a practitioner of your caliber rates a donation of no less than $250.}
{295}{}{(Hang head.) Look, I'm really sorry. I'm not proud of myself, and I would normally never have tried anything like that, but I'll be honest with you: I was desperate for those pills.}
{296}{}{Sorry for the trouble. I think I'd better just go before I dig myself a bigger hole.}
{300}{}{(Doc Jubilee begins to turn red.) I don't think you heard me the first time,}
{301}{}{ boy, }
{302}{}{ woman, }
{303}{}{so listen close: I am a doctor of the NCR. It's a solemn duty, and it came with a solemn oath. You ask me one more time to piss on that oath, the ONLY part of it that's going out the window is "first, do no harm." You got me?}
{304}{}{Alright, screw it. If you're as great as you seem to think you are, maybe you'll be able to sew yourself back together after this.}
{305}{}{Whoa, now. Didn't mean to step on any toes, doc. I'll just leave you be for awhile.}
{310}{}{Say, doc, I was wondering about those heart pills you've got up there on the shelf.}
{311}{}{Are you sure you can't reconsider selling me some of those pills?}
{320}{}{Sorry, Councilman Westin's people are due by to pick those up in }
{321}{}{ days, }
{322}{}{ day, }
{323}{}{and I'm just too busy to mix up another batch in time.}
{324}{}{(Mutters to himself.) Where the hell did I put those pills for Mr. Westin. His heart aint gonna last long without 'em. (He looks up.)
 Oh, sorry. What can I do for you today?}
{325}{}{I couldn't help overhearing what you said about heart pills. I was actually going to ask you about such medicine.}
{330}{}{(Mutters to himself.) I can't believe Mr. Westin's dead. Couldn't have been my fault, I measured out those pills precisely. (He looks up) Oh, sorry. What can I do for you today?}
