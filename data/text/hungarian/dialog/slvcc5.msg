{100}{}{Rabszolga-hajcsár.}
{101}{}{This slaver looks like one mean dude.}
{200}{}{Most megvagy!}
{201}{}{Most meghalsz!}
{202}{}{Shit, Rangers! Time to die!}
{300}{}{You lost or something?}
{301}{}{Don is the one in charge. Talk to him.}
{302}{}{This is private property. No loitering.}
{303}{}{You don't see too many women slavers.}
{304}{}{Klassz, hogy velünk tartasz.}
{305}{}{Helló! Mi újság?}
{306}{}{Fogtál már valaha rabszolgát?}
{307}{}{Helló megint!}
{308}{}{Heading out on another run?}
{309}{}{Egész nyugisan mennek a dolgok.}
{310}{}{Mikor látok már végre valami akciót?}
{311}{}{Bagging slaves always brings a smile to my face.}
{312}{}{A rabszolga-vadászat aztán nagy durranás!}
{313}{}{Hey, glad to have you with us.}
{500}{}{Hey you! What do you think you're doing? I ain't seen you before.}
{501}{}{Metzger sent me to check on his goods. You know how he is. If it isn't perfect, shit hits the fan.
 Now I'm already running late. I need to finish this inspection and report back to him. Do you want to be held responsible
 for delaying me?}
{502}{}{Umm.. uhh... Okay, go right ahead then. I'll be here if you need something.}
{503}{}{Thanks. I'll put in a good word for you with the big man. Bye.}
{504}{}{Funny that Metzger would send someone that doesn't have our tattoo. You ain't fooling me. Time to take out the trash.}
{505}{}{Look, a one headed brahmin!}
{506}{}{But, uh, I've never seen you before. Where's the usual guy?}
{507}{}{He's sick. Bad case of the flu.}
{508}{}{He was killed during a slave run.}
{509}{}{Damn, that's too bad. Well, go ahead then. I'll be here if you need something.}
{510}{}{The flu? Yeah, right. Looks like we got an intruder on our hands.}
{600}{}{I warned you, asshole!}
{800}{}{[DONE]}
