{100}{}{}
{101}{}{Du siehst ein Mitglied des Stammes.}
{102}{}{Du siehst Marli.}
{103}{}{Du siehst einen Krieger mit einem mürrischen Gesichtsausdruck.}
{110}{}{Be gone. I'm seeking council with the spirits and they don't like you, outworlder. If you must speak to me, do it another time.}
{111}{}{Jaja, wie auch immer.}
{112}{}{Hmph. I didn't ask for your help, outworlder. I could have taken care of the well myself.}
{113}{}{Gern geschehen.}
{114}{}{Was auch immer.}
{120}{}{Was willst du?}
{121}{}{Ich sehe, dass du einige Schwierigkeiten mit dem Brunnen hast. Was genau ist kaputt?}
{130}{}{What's wrong? I dropped the rope, that's what's wrong. [He shifts uncomfortably.] I was fastening a new rope to the well and then I looked up and saw this fine young maiden stretching in the sunlight. Spirits of lust distracted me and the rope slipped from my hands and... What's it to you anyway, outworlder? Unless you got a new rope for me, you be wasting my time.}
{131}{}{I don't have a rope on me, but I'll see if I can come up with one. I'll get back to you.}
{132}{}{In der Tat, ich habe eines. Ich werde versuchen, denn Brunnen für euch zu reparieren.}
{133}{}{Nope, I'm afraid you're just going to have to admit to the others what happened. Try to keep your spirits of lust under control next time. Bye.}
{140}{}{Und, hast du den Brunnen repariert?}
{141}{}{Nein, noch nicht.}
{142}{}{Seh ich so aus, als würde ich es reparieren? Du stehst doch die ganze Zeit an diesem scheiß Ding, du Dummkopf!}
{150}{}{Und, hast du den Brunnen repariert?}
{151}{}{Ja, das Seil ist dort wo es hingehört. Siehst du?}
{160}{}{[He glances at the well, then snickers.] What good is a rope if you don't have a bucket attached? Or do you outworlders drink by licking water off a wet rope? [He shakes his head and mutters something under his breath.] Just attach the bucket, and I'll see that you be gettin' a reward.}
{161}{}{Okay.}
{162}{}{Wie wäre es, wenn *du* den Eimer anbringst und ich werd mal schauen, wie ich es verhindern kann, dir in den Arsch zu treten.}
{170}{}{Hast du den Eimer angebracht?}
{171}{}{Nein, noch nicht.}
{172}{}{*Sieht* es so aus, als hätte ich den Eimer angebracht?}
{180}{}{So the well is fixed, yes? With the bucket attached and everything?}
{181}{}{Ja, es ist alles fertig.}
{182}{}{...}
{190}{}{[The corner of his mouth twitches up into a hint of a smile.] Ah, I suppose you outworlders aren't all bad, after all. Here, take this money. The spirits tell me you be needing this more than I.}
{191}{}{Danke.}
{200}{}{May your ancestors guide you well.}
{201}{}{Danke für die Hilfe.}
{202}{}{Nice to be seeing you again.}
{210}{}{Du wirst uns nicht lebend bekommen, Sklavenhändler!}
{300}{}{All right, calm your spirits of anger. I'll do it myself. [He mumbles.] Crazy outworlder...}
{301}{}{[Erledigt]}
{310}{}{[Er sieht dich an, dann den Brunnen.] Nein.}
{311}{}{Then no, I guess I didn't attach it yet.}
{320}{}{Hey, did you hear me? I asked if the well be fixed yet.}
{321}{}{... [Du seufzt, dann deutest du auf den Brunnen.]}
{330}{}{[He turns and looks at the well, then turns back to you.] Yeah, looks right an' proper now. Why not just say so? Here, take this money. The spirits tell me you be needing this more than I.}
{331}{}{... [You take the money and walk away.]}
{400}{}{[As you're about to walk away, Marli looks at you closely and his eyes light up.] Ah! I see you have sub-machine gun. [He gazes longingly at the weapon.] We had one once, but Sulik always be hogging it. Got lost in a battle. Such a pity. My magic would be fearsome strong if I had a soul-taker such as that.}
{401}{}{If you want this one, you can have it. I'm sure I'll find another. [Hand Marli the SMG.]}
{402}{}{Just take it. I don't even want it after the eye raping you're giving it. [Hand Marli the SMG.]}
{403}{}{Yeah, I bet. Anyway, me and my soul-taker are going elsewhere now.}
{404}{}{You keep your magic to yourself, pal. Bye.}
{410}{}{[He grins like a maniac as he looks over the weapon.] Oh, you be a good friend to Marli, outworlder. Here, was saving this sweet bubble-water, but I think you should be having it. [He hands you a Nuka-Cola.] Now I be off to spit fiery death at some geckos. [He runs off to the hunting grounds.]}
{411}{}{My magic be fearsome now!}
{1000}{}{Du hast den Brunnen des Stammes repariert.}
{2000}{}{Sorry if I was a jerk to you, hero.}
{2001}{}{Sorry, I lost your sub-machine gun. That gecko be a fierce one.}
