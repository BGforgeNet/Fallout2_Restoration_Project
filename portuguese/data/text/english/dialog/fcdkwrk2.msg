{100}{}{Você vê um trabalhador portuário. Ele olha para você enquanto você se aproxima.}
{101}{}{Você vê um trabalhador portuário melancólico. Seus olhos cheios de tristeza olham para você enquanto você se aproxima.}
{200}{}{[Murmura para si mesmo.] Oh, que atrocidades o pobre Meng fez em uma vida passada para merecer tal
  infortúnio? Agora, o lao wai vem para mim, e que de bom poderia acontecer? Nenhum, é claro. Nenhum mesmo...}
{201}{}{Por que você não deixa o pobre Meng em paz? [Murmura para si mesmo.] Não que eu já conheci a paz. Ou, se eu fizesse,
  então é esquecido, como um sonho distante ...}
{202}{}{Uh, eu pareço ter pego você em um momento ruim. Tchau.}
{203}{}{Qual é o seu problema, Murmurio?}
{204}{}{Eu notei que você parece estar chateado com alguma coisa. Eu só estava me perguntando se eu poderia ajudar.}
{210}{}{Meu problema? [Ele ri amargamente.] Loa wai, você não deseja saber o meu problema. Para ouvir sobre dores como as minhas
  é esquecer o som do riso de uma criança e o caloroso abraço de um amante. Não, confie em mim, você não deseja vislumbrar o meu inferno pessoal.}
{211}{}{I've witnessed a lot of terrible things in my time. I'm sure that whatever your problem is, I can handle it.}
{212}{}{You think *your* problems are bad? I bet they don't *compare* to things I've been through.}
{213}{}{I'm sorry things have been rough for you, but it might help to talk about it. If you're willing to talk, then I'm willing to listen.}
{214}{}{All right Mr. Melodrama, I'm gonna leave now before you make me depressed. Bye.}
{220}{}{Fine. You want to know my problem. I'll tell you. Two years ago, my brother, who looks very similar to me, had
 an affair with a local gang leader's girlfriend. The gang leader found out about it and my brother fled town. The gang
 caught me instead, and, thinking I was my brother, they severed my penis as punishment. Now I piss through a tube.}
{221}{}{Oh, well— }
{230}{}{Oh no! I'm not done yet. Then my beautiful girlfriend left me, because I was no longer a "real man" and could not
 satisfy her. She then married my next door neighbor, who also happens to be my boss. Now, all day at work, he orders me
 around and mocks me with my co-workers. And every night I must try to fall asleep to the sound of him making love to the
 girl I should have married.}
{231}{}{Hahaha! Holy shit, you're a loser. Why don't you do yourself a favor and just end it?}
{232}{}{I, uh, wow, I'm not sure what to say. That's a terrible story.}
{233}{}{I'm sorry that happened to you, Meng. Life can be cruel, but it can always get better. If I were you, I'd move
 somewhere else and find a different job. Otherwise you'll never be able to move on.}
{240}{}{Yes. Yes, this is what I should have done long ago. It is the only way to retain what little honor I have left.
 Thank you, lao wai. [He takes out a knife and slits his throat. You watch as he quickly bleeds to death.]}
{241}{}{[FEITO]}
{250}{}{Yes. This I warned you about. Now, let me be. I have nothing else to say to you.}
{251}{}{[FEITO]}
{260}{}{Perhaps you are right. All my life, I've known nothing but the Shi. But there is nothing left here for me but sorrow.
 Yes, I think I shall venture out into the world and forge a new destiny. Even if the wastes offer me nothing but a swift
 death, that is preferable to remaining here. Thank you, lao wai.}
{261}{}{Good luck, Meng. I hope your fortunes improve.}
{262}{}{Before you start packing, I was wondering if you could answer a question or two for me?}
{270}{}{Why not? I'm severing all ties to the Shi. Their secrets now mean nothing to me. Ask what you will.}
{271}{}{What can you tell me about that guarded motorboat over there? }
{272}{}{Never mind. Good luck on your new life, Meng.}
{280}{}{The Shi use that motorboat to access our sleeping guardian, the sub.}
{281}{}{What can you tell me about the sub?}
{290}{}{The Shi-Huang-Ti is the submarine that brought our ancestors to this place from a far away land. In the aftermath
 of the Great War it lost power and ran aground in the San Francisco bay. Captain Ye Li and his crew then made their way
 to this city and established what would become the Shi society.}
{291}{}{You referred to it as a "sleeping guardian." What do you mean by that?}
{300}{}{Like a hibernating dragon whose snores can still produce deadly fire -- the sub is immobile, but not helpless.
 The Shi have been working on it in secret, making clandestine trips to the sub under cover of night. Its weapons have
 been reactivated and will surly destroy any non-Chinese vessels that dare to sail through this bay.}
{301}{}{So, let's say, *hypothetically*, if that big tanker that's docked here where to try and set sail...}
{310}{}{Then... BOOM!}
{311}{}{Gotcha. I don't suppose you know how I could disarm it?}
{320}{}{Only the Shi's technicians would know such a thing. I've told you all I know.}
{321}{}{Thanks, Meng. Good luck with your new life.}
{330}{}{Now it is time to begin anew...}
{350}{}{Leave me be, lao wai.}
{400}{}{You convince Meng to move on with his life.}
