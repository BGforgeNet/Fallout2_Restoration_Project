{100}{}{Você vê o patrão do bar.}
{101}{}{Você vê Stacy.}
{102}{}{Ela parece estar um pouco triste.}
{103}{}{Pare com isso!}
{104}{}{Como você pôde?}
{105}{}{Fique longe de mim!}
{106}{}{Por quê?}
{107}{}{Por favor, pare!}
{108}{}{Seu assassino!}
{109}{}{Pobre Mãe! Você vai pagar por isso!}
{110}{}{Mãe...}
{111}{}{Mas ela era tão agradável para todos...}
{112}{}{Desculpe, não consigo pensar em nada mais interessante.}
{113}{}{Meus cérebros estavam secos.}
{114}{}{É isso.}
{115}{}{Olá.}
{116}{}{Você já disse olá para a mãe ainda?}
{117}{}{Ah, oi.}
{118}{}{Ah, você de novo.}
{119}{}{Conte-me sobre seu gato.}
{120}{}{Porque o rosto triste?}
{121}{}{Você vem aqui muitas vezes?}
{122}{}{Eu vou ter que te pegar mais tarde. Tchau.}
{123}{}{Okah?}
{124}{}{Ug.}
{131}{}{Por favor, não me incomoda. Eu realmente não estou com o humor agora.}
{132}{}{Ugra.}
{133}{}{Fegi.}
{134}{}{Oh, nada realmente. Às vezes eu consigo pensar sobre minha mãe e meu gato. Eu sinto tanto falta deles.}
{135}{}{Gato?}
{136}{}{Sorry to hear that. Bye.}
{137}{}{Yeah, Cuddles. She was such a sweet cat. I really don't feel like talking about it... Well, unless you'd like to buy me a drink. That might help.}
{138}{}{As I said, I would prefer not to talk about it right now. If you'd like to buy me a drink, it might loosen my tongue.}
{139}{}{Of course I will. I'd love to hear about it.}
{140}{}{Com certeza.}
{141}{}{Sorry, I can't spare $10 right now.}
{142}{}{Obviously.}
{143}{}{Do you think you're funny or something? Get a better line.}
{144}{}{So why the glum face?}
{145}{}{Seja o que for, adeus.}
{146}{}{I hear there used to be ones that were as big as you and me. They used to eat animals as big as a brahmin. Now that's scary stuff.}
{147}{}{That's nothing.}
{148}{}{Yeah, it is.}
{149}{}{The kind I'm talking about is a small cute animal, bigger than a rat but smaller than a dog. Some are fluffy, like my Cuddles, but others have short hair.}
{150}{}{Realmente?}
{151}{}{They like to be pet like a dog does, but cats make this wonderful relaxing sound when you pet them.}
{152}{}{Strange.}
{153}{}{Cuddles always used to help me go to sleep at night. I think of her every night when I try to go to sleep.}
{154}{}{Sounds nice.}
{155}{}{Continue.
}
{156}{}{I had her when I was a kid, but she disappeared. I didn't know then what happened to her, I was too young.}
{157}{}{Por quê?}
{158}{}{Well, food was awfully scarce back then and people had to eat. It's quite sad really...}
{159}{}{O que?}
{160}{}{People would hunt them because they were such easy prey. None of them are around anymore because of it.}
{161}{}{Sick!}
{162}{}{I can understand that.}
{163}{}{Those were the wild ones, but I'm sure that's what happened to mine. Now I know why Mom always kept a close eye on her.}
{164}{}{How sad.}
{165}{}{I'm sorry.}
{166}{}{Oh...}
{167}{}{It makes me sad to think about it...}
{168}{}{Adeus.}
{169}{}{Stacy told you a sweet story about her darling cat Cuddles.}
