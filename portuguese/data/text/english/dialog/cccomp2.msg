{100}{}{Você vê um técnico.}
{101}{}{Você vê um Enclave técnico.}
{102}{}{Você vê alguém usando um bata de laboratório. Ele parece confiante e seguro de si mesmo.}
{103}{}{Sim, soldado?}
{104}{}{O que este lugar?}
{105}{}{Eu apenas disse oi. Eu vou agora.}
{106}{}{O que é este lugar?}
{107}{}{Só dizendo Oi. Até mais.
}
{108}{}{This is the computer room. That’s the mainframe over there, the interface terminal is next to it, and these devices are the holotape data storage units. This is the latest and the greatest.}
{109}{}{Oh. Uh, what you do?}
{110}{}{So, what do you do here?}
{111}{}{I’m the senior computer analyst. I get to maintain all of the equipment here.}
{112}{}{Oh. Me use computer?}
{113}{}{Me no understand. Me go.}
{114}{}{Say, can I use the system for a minute? You know, check it out?}
{115}{}{Hey, nice talking to you. I’ll see you later.}
{116}{}{Well... I’m not supposed to allow anyone other than trained personnel to use the equipment. It’s all rather complex and delicate, you understand.}
{117}{}{Please? Me no break.}
{118}{}{I promise not to break it.}
{119}{}{All right. You can access the system from the terminal over there. Just be careful, please. They’ll shoot us both if you damage that machine. Oh, the guest password is ‘Snookie.’}
{120}{}{I’m sorry but it’s out of the question. I’m not even supposed to allow enlisted personnel in the room let alone allow them to use the equipment.}
{121}{}{Snookie? What is snookie?}
{122}{}{Ok. Me understand.}
{123}{}{Snookie? What the hell is a snookie?}
{124}{}{All right. I understand.}
{125}{}{‘Snookie’ is my girlfriend’s nickname. I think it’s cute. That’s her out in the hall by the way. She’s one of the guards.}
{126}{}{Ok, fine. Thanks.}
{127}{}{Yeah... cute. Thanks.}
{128}{}{You’re out of uniform. }
{129}{}{You better suit up. Armory is down the hall on the left.}
{130}{}{You’re taking a big chance being out of uniform. You better report to supply.}
{131}{}{Who the hell are you guys... Alert! Intruders!}
{132}{}{We’ve been infiltrated! Alert!}
{133}{}{Multiple intruders! Sound the alarm!}
{134}{}{Shit! Get the backups started.}
{135}{}{Shut down all classified operations.}
{136}{}{Secure the system and enable all security passwords.}
{137}{}{I’m a scientist, not a fighter!}
{138}{}{Pointy end with the laser diode goes toward the enemy. Then pull trigger.}
{139}{}{Help! Help! To the computer lab!}
