{100}{}{Você vê um guarda.}
{101}{}{Você vê um guarda em armadura de poder.}
{102}{}{Você vê alguém vestindo armadura de energia de um design incomum. Há uma insígnia no peitoral que você não conhece.}
{103}{}{Nada a assinalar.}
{104}{}{Nada de errado comigo, que tal você?}
{105}{}{Não deveria estar no seu posto, soldado? Não é bom para passear aqui.}
{106}{}{Você está fora do uniforme.}
{107}{}{É melhor informar o Sargento e se adequar.}
{108}{}{Você está tendo uma grande chance de estar fora de uniforme. Melhor você informar ao fornecimento.}
{109}{}{Quem diabos são vocês... Alerta! Intrusos!}
{110}{}{Temos sido infiltrados! Alerta!}
{111}{}{Vários intrusos! Soar o alarme!}
{112}{}{Alerta de segurança! Selo de base!}
{113}{}{Proteja todas as estações! Estamos em alerta!}
{114}{}{Alerta de intrusão! Vá código vermelho!}
{115}{}{Nós vamos colocá-lo abaixo!}
{116}{}{O Enclave vai dominar o mundo!}
{117}{}{Você morre para que o Enclave sobreviva!}
{200}{}{...imbecil...}
{201}{}{...sim, é MELHOR você ir embora...}
{202}{}{... o que um caipira marrom...}
{203}{}{...sim, senhor! fuckin' senhor!...}
{300}{}{Aguarde lá. O que você acha que está fazendo com essa aeronave? Não há vôos programados por vários dias.}
{301}{}{Nrg?}
{302}{}{Eu estou ciente disso.}
{303}{}{Sinto muito. Eu só estava procurando. Eu vou estar indo agora.}
{304}{}{Houve uma mudança de planos. Eu estou tomando esta aeronave.}
{310}{}{O que? Oh, eu vejo. Olhe, mas não toque. Tudo bem? Toque novamente e você morre.}
{311}{}{(Sorriso, em seguida, atacar.)}
{312}{}{(Ir embora.)
}
{315}{}{Oh merda, parece que nos conseguimos um intruso. Código vermelho! Eu repito, código vermelho!}
{316}{}{That sounds like a good idea. Touch the aircraft again and I'll put a bullet in your head.}
{320}{}{Right. And therefore you are...}
{321}{}{About to leave. Sorry to bother you.}
{322}{}{About to deliver an important message to the main base.}
{323}{}{Oh, really? And what does this message say.}
{324}{}{It's super top secret. I cannot tell you.}
{325}{}{I'll tell you, but it's absolutely essential that you don't disclose this information to anyone else, for fear of a
 mass panic. You see, it's come to my attention that one of the recent shipments of slaves is infected with an unknown, and
 highly deadly, virus strain. I *must* get to the base immediately, or all our lives could be lost. Now stop wasting my time,
 as there isn't a moment to spare.}
{326}{}{Yeah, I believe you. Looks like we got ourselves an intruder...}
{327}{}{Damnit! Ah, whatever. I never get told shit around here. Fine. Be on your way.}
{328}{}{Woah, that sounds bad. You better get moving then, I don't want this shit on my hands. Oh, and don't worry, I won't tell anyone.}
{329}{}{[FEITO]}
{400}{}{[After a half hour of sitting in the dark cargo hold, you feel the craft touch down to earth once more. A moment
 later, the cargo door opens and you see a squad of power armored soldiers. One of them does a double take at you then
 turns to the others.] Holy shit! One of those mutie wastlanders stowed away in the 'bird! ALERT! We got an intruder!}

{402}{}{[Jump out and see how many you can take down before they waste you.]}
{403}{}{[Raise hands in surrender and hope for the best.]}
{410}{}{Aw, it doesn't look like the mutie's gonna put up a fight. Maybe we should bring him to the Commander -- see
 what he wants to do about this.}

 are you doing back here? You weren't authorized to be on that mission. What's your name, soldier?}
{421}{}{It doesn't matter what my name is, 'cause I'm not here to talk. [Jump out and start fighting.]}
{422}{}{Me? Oh, I'm, uh, *cough*mumble*cough*. Don't mind me, though. In fact, I should probably be going now.
 [Get out and attempt to walk away nonchalantly.]}
{423}{}{My name's }
{424}{}{. Where am I?}
{425}{}{No, what's *your* name, soldier? I was put here to test you and I gotta say you FAILED. If I were a wasteland
 suicide assassin you and your whole crew would be dead right now! That is unacceptable! Shape up, soldier!}
{426}{}{Uh . . . my name }
{427}{}{. I take fun ride in metal birdie! Go again! Wanna go again!}
{428}{}{You not need know my name. I no like you. I kill. [Jump out and start fighting.]}
{430}{}{What are you, drunk? You're at Navarro, of course. If you're having memory problems, soldier, you might wanna go get yourself checked out. Maybe some of that radiation out there got to you.}
{440}{}{Don't give me that bullshit. You're one of the new recruits, aren't you? Heh. That smart mouth of yours is gonna land you in all sorts of trouble--and I can't wait to see it happen. Now get back to your post, soldier.}
{450}{}{Sir! Yes sir!}
{451}{}{Ma'am! Yes ma'am!}
{460}{}{[The soldier looks at one of his comrades.] My God, contact with all the muties and radiation out there must have made him retarded. You see? *That's* why I never volunteer for those wasteland runs. Anyway, let's put this stupid bastard out of his misery before he contaminates us.}
