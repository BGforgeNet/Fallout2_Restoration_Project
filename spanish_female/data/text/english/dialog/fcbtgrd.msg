{100}{}{Ves a un guardia de los Escorias.}
{101}{}{This scowling man appears to be guarding the motorboat. He seems to be taking his job very seriously.}
{200}{}{¿Puedo ayudarte en algo?}
{201}{}{Apuesto a que sí. Adiós.}
{202}{}{Me preguntaba qué es lo que haces aquí.}
{203}{}{Say, that's a nice boat you got there. Does that thing still work?}
{204}{}{Me ride metal fishy-fish?}
{210}{}{No es asunto tuyo, cuatro ojos. Lárgate.}
{211}{}{Poor choice of words, asshole. They're gonna be your last.}
{212}{}{I can take a hint. No need to be a dick about it. Bye.}
{213}{}{Lo que tu digas.}
{220}{}{[He looks at you as if you're dumbest creature he could possibly imagine. Slowly, he shakes his head.] You no ride metal fishy-fish. You go. You go, or I shoot. Understand?}
{221}{}{Bien, adiós.}
{222}{}{You meanie-man. Me smash meanie-man!}
{230}{}{[The guard grips his weapon and glares at you wordlessly.]}
{231}{}{¿Puedo unirme a tu tribu?}
{232}{}{I was just checking to see if you're still an asshole. Yep, looks like you are. Bye.}
{233}{}{Perdón, pensaba que eras otra persona. Adiós.}
{234}{}{I hope you know how to use that thing, 'cause I plan on taking that fucking boat, one way or another.}
{240}{}{[He looks at you as if you're dumbest creature he could possibly imagine. Slowly, he shakes his head.] No. Now go away. Ask me another question, and I'll hurt you.}
{241}{}{Está bien, ya me marcho.}
{242}{}{¿Eso es un lao wai?}
{250}{}{¡Lárgate de aquí!}
{251}{}{Vuelve a tocar mis putas cosas y te mato.}
{252}{}{Mierda... ¡te lo advertí!}
