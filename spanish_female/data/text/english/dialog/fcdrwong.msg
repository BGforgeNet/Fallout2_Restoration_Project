{100}{}{Ves a un Shi bajo y corpulento.}
{101}{}{Ves al doctor Wong Yi Tze.}
{102}{}{Ves a un Shi bajo y corpulento.}
{103}{}{¿Puedo ayudarte en algo?}
{104}{}{¿Daghi nu?}
{105}{}{¿Quién?}
{106}{}{He oído que tienes el bazo de alguien.}
{107}{}{¿Quién eres?}
{108}{}{¿Qué haces aquí?}
{109}{}{No, gracias. Eso es todo.}
{110}{}{Debo confesar que no hablo tu idioma. Quizá deberías hablar con Ken Lee, que comprende muchos idiomas distintos.}
{111}{}{¡Aagh!}
{112}{}{Soy el doctor Wong. Soy el científico jefe de esta instalación.}
{113}{}{Más preguntas, por favor.}
{114}{}{Gracias. Adiós.}
{115}{}{Superviso los experimentos científicos que creamos y dirigimos aquí. También estoy a cargo de la red de computadoras.}
{116}{}{¿Qué estáis planeando?}
{117}{}{¿Cómo consigue uno acceso a la red de computadoras?}
{118}{}{Tengo otras preguntas.}
{119}{}{Ya veo. Adiós.}
{120}{}{Ah, pero si te cuento nuestros planes, entonces todo el mundo los sabrá. Me temo que son planes secretos, por ahora.}
{121}{}{Bien, bien. Tengo otras preguntas.}
{122}{}{Gracias. Adiós.}
{123}{}{¿Y qué tal si te pongo una pistola bajo la nariz y te obligo a que me lo cuentes?}
{124}{}{Pues uno aprende cómo piratearla, o cómo hacer amigos entre mis subordinados. Estoy bromeando, por supuesto, sobre lo de piratear: si fueras a hacer eso, tendría que enviar alguien tras de ti para matarte [sonríe para mostrar que no tiene ánimo de ofender].}
{125}{}{¿Realmente me matarías?}
{126}{}{¿Así que no tendrías ninguna auténtica objeción a que entrase en la computadora?}
{127}{}{Tengo algunas otras preguntas.}
{128}{}{Por supuesto que lo harías. Adiós.}
{129}{}{Entonces tendría que considerarlo como una amenaza y avisarte de que ese curso de acción podría resultar perjudicial para tu salud.}
{130}{}{Hagamos la prueba.}
{131}{}{Sólo estaba bromeando. Tengo otras preguntas.}
{132}{}{[Sonríe] Debemos proteger nuestro honor, forastera.}
{133}{}{Err, bien. ¿Así que no tendrías ninguna auténtica objeción a que entrase en la computadora?}
{134}{}{Vaaaale. Tengo otras preguntas.}
{135}{}{Apuesto a que sí. Adiós.}
{136}{}{Si puedes convencer a mis subordinados para que lo hagan... pero ciertamente no será así.}
{137}{}{¿Y si te pongo una pistola bajo la nariz?}
{138}{}{Genial. Bueno, tengo más preguntas.}
{139}{}{Hmm. Ya veo. Bueno, hasta luego.}
{140}{}{¡Ahh, sí! Ya lo creo. Lo prepararé con habas y un buen chianti.}
{141}{}{¿Aún lo tienes? Bien. Chip lo necesita de vuelta.}
{142}{}{Es un bazo humano, enfermo hijo de puta!}
{143}{}{Sabes que se supone que se sirve hígado con ese vino en lugar de bazo, ¿verdad?}
{144}{}{Es un bazo humano, ¿sabes?}
{145}{}{¿Quién es ese tal Chip? Ahora es mi bazo, y lo tengo para cenar.}
{146}{}{Chip es el propietario original del bazo. Estaba borracho y se lo vendió a Lao Chou.}
{147}{}{Lo necesita para sobrevivir, ¿sabes? Procede del interior de su cuerpo.}
{148}{}{Entonces lo mejor será que te mate para conseguirlo.}
{149}{}{Un trato es un trato. No puede tenerlo. Lo siento, pero hicimos un pacto y sólo porque Chip lo lamente ahora no significa que se pueda dar marcha atrás en el trato.}
{150}{}{[MÁS]}
{151}{}{¿Es un bazo humano? ¡Lao Chou no me dijo nada de eso!}
{152}{}{Sin embargo, debido a la rudeza del mensajero, creo que me quedaré con todas las partes del trato. Así que me limitaré a experimentar con él.}
{153}{}{Dile a tu amigo que se pase por aquí en los próximos días, y con gusto se lo devolveré. Tan solo espero que puedas encontrar una forma de recolocarlo en su cuerpo a tiempo.}
{154}{}{Muy bien.}
{155}{}{¡Ja ja! Sí, yo también vi esa vieja película. Espera... ¿qué estás diciendo? ¿Estás diciendo que...?}
{156}{}{Sí, es un bazo humano.}
{157}{}{En realidad, me opondría a eso. No has demostrado tener buen carácter. De hecho, no sé por qué estoy hablando contigo. Buenos días.}
{158}{}{[HECHO]}
{159}{}{¡Aaah! ¡Guardias! ¡La lao wai intrusa está aquí!}
{160}{}{¿Tienes ciertos esquemas que darme?}
{161}{}{Ken Lee me dijo que te entregase esto.}
{162}{}{Sí. Ahora, ¿qué hay para mí?}
{163}{}{No, aún no.}
{164}{}{Habla con Ken Lee, y él discutirá lo que pasa con tu futuro. Gracias. Con esto podremos verificar algunos de nuestros datos de prueba. Buenos días.}
{165}{}{En realidad tenía otras preguntas.}
{166}{}{Hasta la vista.}
{200}{}{I found this corpse stashed over at the Hubologists' base. I believe it might be your missing Xeno Project specimen.}
{201}{}{Yes, it is indeed! My predecessor had much invested in this subject and was quite distressed when it went missing. Although he is now gone, we still may have some use for this specimen. Thank you for retrieving this.}
{202}{}{Olvídalo. Te veré más tarde.}
{203}{}{Hold on there. No one said I did this for free.}
{204}{}{Correct. Nor did anyone ask you to retrieve the subject. You did that and brought it here of your own volition. Now the stolen subject has been returned to its rightful owners, and we thank you for it.}
{205}{}{That's nice, but I found it, so if you want it back, then it's going to cost you.}
{206}{}{¡No tienes tiempo para esto!}
{207}{}{[The man looks like he is about to yell, then calms down.] Fine. Here is $500. More than enough for something
 that always belonged to us. Now leave, I'm a busy man.}
{208}{}{Gracias. Es un placer hacer negocios contigo.}
{209}{}{¡Oh, mierda!}
{210}{}{Bailemos.}
{211}{}{You recover the missing Xeno Program specimen.}
{220}{}{So where is it then? Are you trying to play games with me?}
{221}{}{Sorry, I like to try and hoard as many items as I can. It's kinda my thing.}
{230}{}{No tengo tiempo para esto. Me largo de aquí.}
{240}{}{[He sniffs the air.] What is that smell? Like rotten meat. [He looks at you and raises an eyebrow.]}
{241}{}{Oh, you must be smelling this body I found. I'm not really sure why I'm carrying it around, to be honest.}
{242}{}{Huh-huh! [You pull out the decomposing corpse] Stinky body! U want?}
{250}{}{Wait a second, that's the subject from the Xeno Project! My predecessor had much invested in this subject and was quite distressed when it went missing. Although he is now gone, we still may have some use for this subject. Thank you.}
{251}{}{No, I do not want— Wait a second, that's the subject from the Xeno Project! My predecessor had much invested in . . . [He notices your blank stare.] Ahem. I mean, thank you for the body. Good job. Don't bring any more though. This is enough. Bye now!}
{252}{}{Adiós}
{253}{}{Eh, eso pica un poco.}
{300}{}{¿Qué pasa con el sur?}
{310}{}{How do you know about Dr. Sheng? Eh, I suppose it doesn't matter. Dr. Sheng Ming was a brilliant, but rather unpleasant man who served as my predecessor. He is no longer of any great relevance here.}
{311}{}{Oh, eso no es como lo que estoy buscando. Otra pregunta.}
{312}{}{¿Qué le ha pasado a Flick?}
{320}{}{What happened? I'd say he lost his mind. During his experiments he stumbled upon something which I admit was rather remarkable, but it was also extremely dangerous and in no way related to the goals of the Shi. But that did not matter to Dr. Sheng. He became obsessed with his creation and since his experiments were deemed too dangerous to continue here, he decided to take them elsewhere. He left on sabbatical and never returned. That is when I stepped up to fill his position.}
{321}{}{What kind of experiments was Dr. Sheng performing? And what exactly was his big discovery?}
{322}{}{¿Dónde está ahora?}
{330}{}{As a man of science, I respect your inquisitive nature. However, I'm afraid I am not willing to share the secrets of the Shi with you, stranger.}
{331}{}{¿Dónde está ahora?}
{332}{}{Fine, you keep your fancy secrets. I have secrets of my own, you know. Better secrets than you could ever possibly imagine.}
{340}{}{[He smiles politely.] I'm sure you do. Now if you will excuse me, I have plenty of work that needs doing. Good day.}
{341}{}{[HECHO]}
{350}{}{Dr. Sheng was escorted a day or so to the south. He took up residence in some abandoned home, if I'm not mistaken. He was only supposed to be gone for a month, but it's been much longer and we have yet to hear from him. If I were to guess, I would say he was either destroyed by his own creations, or else fell victim to the numerous hazards of the wasteland.}
{351}{}{One of your lead scientists could be dead, and you don't care? You're not even going to go look into it?}
{352}{}{I think I'd like follow up on this Dr. Sheng guy. Could you give me his last known location?}
{353}{}{Espera un minuto. Déjame preguntarte sobre otra cosa.}
{360}{}{You'll have to excuse me for seeming so callous about the matter. The truth is, Dr. Sheng was not very popular around here and I do not believe any of us miss him in the slightest.}
{361}{}{I think I'd like follow up on this Dr. Sheng guy. Could you give me his last known location?}
{362}{}{Ya veo. Deja que te pregunte algo más.}
{370}{}{I suppose I could... I must admit I am somewhat curious to learn of his fate. Here, I'll mark Dr. Sheng's last known location on your mapping device. But I must warn you that it could prove to be highly dangerous. Of course, it is always dangerous out there in the wastes. Anyway, if you find something of interest, do let me know.}
{371}{}{Gracias, lo haré. Adiós.}
{372}{}{Déjame hacerte otra pregunta.}
{380}{}{Dr. Sheng is still alive and he's created some kind of plant that takes root in and controls human corpses.}
{390}{}{So he has achieved some success with his Xeno Project. How fascinating ... and disturbing. We put an end to his sentient plant experiments here after we lost one our techs. When he left to continue his research, I assumed he'd fall victim to his own creations. Has he managed to assume some form of control over them?}
{391}{}{Yeah, some of them seem to be subservient. They even refer to him as 'master.'}
{400}{}{Hmm… If he were to somehow establish an army of those plant-creatures, that would not bode well for the Shi. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but it seems we have no choice but to ensure that Dr. Sheng and his experiments are eliminated. Since he trusts you enough to allow you get close to him, you are the best candidate. Is that something you'd be willing to do? You would be compensated, of course.}
{401}{}{It'd be a pleasure. The guy and his whole operation creeps me out.}
{402}{}{¿De qué clase de transmisiones hablas?}
{403}{}{Not interested. Dr. Sheng's your problem—you guys can deal with him.}
{410}{}{The Shi will be most grateful for this service. Once Dr. Sheng and all of his creations have been eliminated, report back to me to receive your reward.}
{411}{}{[HECHO]}
{420}{}{I'll leave that up to you. We could grant you weapons, supplies, or money. You may decide once the task is complete.}
{421}{}{Está bien, lo haré. }
{422}{}{Not interested. Dr. Sheng's your problem—you guys can deal with him.}
{423}{}{All right. I'll do it. But before I go, Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{430}{}{Fair enough. We will handle the problem ourselves, but it will have to wait, as we don't have the resources to expend at the moment. Hopefully it won't be too late once we are able to act. In the meantime, if you should change your mind, please let me know.}
{431}{}{No cuentes con ello.}
{432}{}{Pensaré en ello. Adiós.}
{433}{}{Ya veo. Deja que te pregunte algo más.}
{440}{}{¿Has cambiado de opinión? ¿Me ayudarás a salir de aquí?}
{441}{}{Quería preguntarte otra cosa.}
{442}{}{De acuerdo, te llevaré a tu hogar.}
{443}{}{I'll do it, but for a price. You were talking about compensation before?}
{450}{}{Our scouts have reported that Dr. Sheng and his experiments have been destroyed. Such a waste of a brilliant mind… Anyway, you may claim your reward. Are you interested in weapons, supplies, or cash?}
{451}{}{Our scouts have reported that Dr. Sheng and his experiments have been destroyed. Such a waste of a brilliant mind… Anyway, we never asked you to get so involved, but we are grateful. For your troubles, you may claim a reward. Are you interested in weapons, supplies, or cash?}
{452}{}{Me llevaré uno.}
{453}{}{Sólo quería unos suministros.}
{454}{}{Dame ya el dinero.}
{455}{}{Keep your reward. I only did it because it was the right thing to do.}
{460}{}{Here you go. [He hands various high powered weapons]}
{461}{}{[HECHO]}
{470}{}{Here you go. [He hands you various supplies]}
{471}{}{[HECHO]}
{480}{}{Here you go. [He hands you $5,000]}
{481}{}{[HECHO]}
{490}{}{The Shi appreciates your assistance. Now, I have much work to do. Good day.}
{491}{}{[HECHO]}
{500}{}{Before I go, Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{501}{}{Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{502}{}{Dr. Sheng wanted me to give you this plant sample as a gift, but I thought I should warn you that it's infused with his sentience serum. I don't know what it's supposed to do, but I'm pretty sure it won't be good for the Shi.}
{510}{}{Interesting. [He takes the sample and stores it away.] My team and I will examine it later. I can't say I trust any gift from Dr. Sheng, but I suppose there is an off chance that it'll prove useful. We shall see. Now if there is nothing else, I should be getting back to work.}
{511}{}{Interesting. [He takes the sample and stores it away.] My team and I will examine it later. I can't say I trust any gift from Dr. Sheng, but I suppose there is an off chance that it'll prove useful. We shall see. But I thought you were going to eliminate Dr. Sheng, not be his courier? In any case, I should be getting back to work.}
{512}{}{En realidad, me gustaría hacerte algunas preguntas.}
{513}{}{Adiós.}
{514}{}{Actually, I went through quite a bit of trouble to get that sample for you. I think it's worth a reward.}
{520}{}{Do you, now? The Shi did not solicit this plant sample from you, but if you feel your deeds have earned some compensation, I suppose we could spare this. [He hands you a super stimpak.] Now I really should be getting back to work.}
{521}{}{En realidad, me gustaría hacerte algunas preguntas.}
{522}{}{Gracias. Adiós.}
{523}{}{Really? You call this a reward? I'm gonna knock you around until something more valuable falls out.}
{530}{}{[Takes the seed.] Thank you, I will dispose of this immediately. [He sighs.] I knew Dr. Sheng had lost it, but I didn't think he'd go so far as to try and destroy his own people. He must be dealt with immediately.}
{531}{}{Tengo asuntos que tratar con el comandante.}
{540}{}{*clutches heart* Wahh.}
{541}{}{Urgh.}
{542}{}{Doctor Wong}
{600}{}{Activas el campo de fuerza.}
{601}{}{Le he entregado el antídoto de Jet a doctor John.}
{602}{}{Has asesinado a Westin.}
