{101}{}{Ves un terminal. Parece estar operativo.}
{102}{}{Ahora la bomba de agua funciona correctamente.}
{103}{}{You are going to need more than just your hands to fix this machine. Perhaps some tools would help with installing
 this part.}
{104}{}{Has reparado la bomba de agua.}
{105}{}{No has conseguido reparar la bomba.}
{106}{}{Has descubierto de lo que va mal en la bomba de agua.}
{200}{}{You open the machine and look inside. You see a lot of rusty gears and motors. One of the motors
 has a crack in it.}
{201}{}{Lo dejas para otro día.}
{202}{}{Investigar más.}
{203}{}{Upon closer inspection you see that the crack is not the cause of the trouble, but rather
 the connection for where the wires go. The connectors seem to have burned out over the years of use. It's going to
 take a whole new motor as well as a new set of wires to get this machine working again.}
