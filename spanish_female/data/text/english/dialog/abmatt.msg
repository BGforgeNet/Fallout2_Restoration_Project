{100}{}{Ves a un monje de mediana edad.}
{101}{}{Ves al Hermano Matthew.}
{102}{}{Él está de pie en un podio predicando a los ciudadanos de Abbey.}
{200}{}{Buena gente de la Abbey. Tomaos un momento para escuchar, porque tengo mucho que decir.}
{201}{}{Aquí recogemos, las sagradas reliquias de un era pasada.}
{202}{}{Arrasada por el Diluvio de Llamas, en la oscuridad, fueron arrojados.}
{203}{}{A Memorabilia we shall make, to preserve the wisdom of old.}
{204}{}{We must guard and care for it, though the flame has gone cold;}
{205}{}{It could ignite once again, should the wisdom be misused.}
{206}{}{Thus, no one shall learn, for fear of another, Flame Deluge.}
{207}{}{But one day, men shall rise above their desire for destruction.}
{208}{}{And the Memorabilia will be there, awaiting re-introduction.}
{209}{}{So we tend to our holy task, lest all that wisdom, we lose.}
{210}{}{We must preserve and protect it, but never shall we use.}
{211}{}{So go now my friends, and let your spirits be lifted;}
{212}{}{For the guardians of knowledge, we have each, been gifted.}
{213}{}{Now, please take a moment and reflect on what I have said.}
{224}{}{Now, please take a moment and reflect on what I have said.}
{300}{}{Greetings, friend. I don't think I have seen you around here before. My name is Brother Matthew and I help
 spread the word about the importance of preserving the knowledge of the old ones.}
{301}{}{Es bueno conocerte Matt. Mi nombre es }
{302}{}{ y estoy en una misión para el sagrado GECK.}
{303}{}{Lo siento, he de irme.}
{400}{}{A GECK, huh? I seem to remember reading something about that during one of my transcribing sessions. So it must
 be in our database, but I'm afraid access to our computers is restricted. However, if you talk to the Abbot, it's
 possible he'll grant you access. It couldn't hurt to try, anyway. Oh, and feel free to browse through our collection
 of holy pre-war relics. I'd ask you not to damage anything, but I'm afraid everything's already broken beyond repair.}
{401}{}{Ahora mismo no. Aunque tengo otras preguntas para ti.}
{402}{}{Gracias. Creo que voy a lo haré ahora.}
{500}{}{Estoy a tu servicio. ¿Qué quieres saber?}
{501}{}{¿Qué puedes contarme sobre este lugar?}
{502}{}{You seem to be very poetic in your preaching. Any reason for this?}
{503}{}{Olvídalo. Cuídate.}
{600}{}{The Abbey is home to anyone, so long as they don't cause trouble. We are an independent community and rarely get
 visitors, such as yourself. The majority of those you see here are descended from the original founders that settled in
 this old monastery not long after the great Flame Deluge.}
{601}{}{Sigue.}
{602}{}{The quiet, peaceful quality of this place has made it an appealing home to other travelers that have wandered
 here over the years, seeking to escape from the dark chaos of the wastes. Of course, the true value of this place lies
 in its vast library. It's filled with old tomes, containing the strange wisdom of a lost age. Over time, we've come to
 fancy ourselves the keepers and guardians of that wisdom.}
{603}{}{Muy interesante. ¿Otra pregunta?}
{604}{}{Interesante. Bien, he de irme. }
{700}{}{[The man chuckles at your question] No, no particular reason. I have just read much poetry throughout my life
 and I enjoy applying it to my teachings. It helps leave a greater impact on those listening.}
{701}{}{Me parece justo. ¿Otra pregunta?}
{800}{}{Qué bueno verte de nuevo.}
{801}{}{. ¿Qué puedo hacer por ti?}
{802}{}{Tengo algunas preguntas.}
{803}{}{Nada. Ya nos veremos.}
