{100}{}{Ves a una mujer joven.}
{101}{}{Ves a Connar.}
{102}{}{Parece estar ocupada charlando.}
{200}{}{Why hello there, I'm Connar's wife, Ann. You must be the one who helped us out. I can't tell you how much
 we appreciate all you've done. It's hard to believe that we can finally live in peace without fear of Vault City's goons
 coming to take us from our homes.}
{201}{}{Glad to be of assistance. You seem to be quite busy here. Need some help with anything?}
{202}{}{Sin problema. Nos vemos.}
{300}{}{Actually, I *could* use some help. Now that we're becoming more organized, we're starting to see our numbers
 grow. The problem is, I'm not sure we'll have enough food to go around. My husband has attempted to get the caravans
 to stop here, but they don't' think we're worth their time. I don't suppose you could get them to reconsider?}
{301}{}{Creo que he tenido suficiente de tus recuerdos difusos por ahora. Adiós.}
{302}{}{Can't you people ever deal with your own fucking problems? Bye.}
{303}{}{Veré lo que puedo hacer. Antes, déjame hacerte algunas otras preguntas.}
{310}{}{One of the caravan masters, Mr. Baron, will be passing by here shortly. The caravan trail isn't far from this
 village. If you could go out there and meet with him, we'd all appreciate it greatly.}
{311}{}{Está bien, te lo venderé a ti. Aquí está el chip.}
{312}{}{No del todo. Te avisaré cuando esté listo. Gracias.}
{313}{}{Pensándolo bien, creo que esta distancia es la correcta.}
{320}{}{¿Estás listo para continuar con el plan?}
{321}{}{Lo tengo. Adiós.}
{322}{}{De acuerdo. Están listos.}
{330}{}{Oh, it's you! Thank you for speaking with Mr. Baron. He had just come by to make trade arrangements with my husband.
 You've done so much to help us, we're forever in your debt!}
{331}{}{Sólo pensé que debías saberlo. Cuídate.}
{332}{}{¿Estás buscando Jet? Hablemos.}
{340}{}{[Ann looks a bit flustered.] Well, yes...alright fine. I had a little something stored away for an emergency, but
 I suppose you can have it. And to think I saw you as a good person.}
{341}{}{No eres el adecuado para esta tarea. Adiós.}
{342}{}{Lo siento, no tengo nada para ti. Adiós.}
{350}{}{Oh, it's you! I heard what you did to Mr. Baron. I never did care for him, but you didn't have to kill him. We'll
 stifle as a community without proper trade.}
{351}{}{Lo siento, no puedo. Adiós.}
{352}{}{No hay problema. Adiós.}
{353}{}{You don't need to worry about any damn merchants. Because I plan on killing the whole lot of you.}
{400}{}{¿Ciudad Refugio tiene uno?}
{401}{}{¡Ya sabes que no tenemos que pelear!}
{402}{}{No tengo nada más que decirte.}
{403}{}{Gracias de nuevo por ayudarnos.}
{404}{}{¡Muchísimas gracias!}
{405}{}{Finally we are safe.}
{406}{}{Thanks for everything! Be sure to stop by again once we expand the place. I'll finally have a working kitchen to cook in.}
{410}{}{Hola de nuevo.}
{411}{}{You seem to be quite busy here. Need some help with anything?}
{412}{}{No importa. Adiós.}
{420}{}{¿Cómo lo sabes?}
{421}{}{How did what go? Oh, the merchant. Actually, I lost interest with him and wandered off.}
{430}{}{What!? You realize this was our last chance to make arragements with him. We look like fools now standing him up.
 You've doomed us.}
{431}{}{Lo siento, no puedo. Adiós.}
{432}{}{No hay problema. Adiós.}
{433}{}{You don't need to worry about any damn merchants. Because I plan on killing the whole lot of you.}
{500}{}{You convinced the merchant to add the village to his trade route.}
{510}{}{You killed the merchant, thus ensuring that the village won't be able to trade.}
{511}{}{You fail to convince the merchant to add the village to his trade route.}
