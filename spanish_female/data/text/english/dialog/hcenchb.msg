{100}{}{Ves a una persona aburrida, vestida con una armadura de cuero.}
{101}{}{Ves a Max, el guardia de las caravanas.}
{102}{}{Ves a una persona polvorienta y aburrida, vistiendo una armadura de cuero. Por el olor a brahmin y la confiada
 forma de caminar, esta persona es claramente un guardia de caravana.}
{103}{}{¿Puedo ayudarte en algo?}
{104}{}{¿Urg?}
{105}{}{¡Tra-bajo aquí!}
{106}{}{¿Quién eres?}
{107}{}{¿Qué puedes contarme sobre Chad?}
{108}{}{No tengo paciencia para los idiotas. Lo siento, amigo, pero tendrás que buscar a algún otro con quien jugar.}
{109}{}{::sniff::}
{110}{}{Soy Max. Uno de los guardias de las caravanas.}
{111}{}{¿Qué puedes contarme sobre Chad?}
{112}{}{Gracias. Adiós.}
{113}{}{Honestly? I don't care for the guy. Lately, he's been tossing around a lot of coin. I mean, sure, he's the
 caravan master, so it makes sense for him to take a larger cut—I understand that. But there's no way he should be
 *that* loaded. I think it'd be *real* interesting to take a peek at his records.}
{114}{}{Bueno, Marcus sospecha que está rociando parte del dinero que se supone que va a Broken Hills.}
{115}{}{Gracias. Adiós.}
{116}{}{Gracias. Estoy muy contento de que se acabó. Pero será mejor de que vigila tu espalda.}
{117}{}{Adiós.}
{118}{}{¡Es el enemigo! ¡Muere!}
{119}{}{Ups.}
{120}{}{[Lowers his voice and looks around.] That's gotta be it. In fact, I was a guard on the latest uranium run to
 Gecko, and I overheard Chad arguing with their ghoul rep. Apparently, Broken Hills had recently been jacking up the
 price of uranium, and the ghoul wasn't too happy about it. Then I hear Chad explain to him our uranium supply was
 running low due to a recent miners' strike, but the thing is, there never was a strike.}
{121}{}{De verdad? Entonces, ¿por qué no lo has dicho a Marcus?}
{122}{}{Are you insane? Chad's a powerful guy in this town and he's got a lot of friends. If I try to rat him out, there's a lot of people that'd hate me. Hell, I might even get killed.}
{123}{}{Hmm, podría decirlo a Marcus, porque no hacer el plan a quedar aquí demasiado tiempo de todos modos.}
{124}{}{De acuerdo. Haz lo que quieras, pero no dice nada sobre me. Y nunca tuvimos esta conversación, vale?}
{125}{}{No hay problema. Adiós.}
{126}{}{Actually, one more thing. I know Chad keeps records of all the transactions he makes. He's kind of a record freak.
 In fact, the guy's such a nut about it, I bet he even has records of all the money he's been skimming. The problem is,
 he keeps all the stuff locked up in his house on the other side of town, and there's no way you're getting in there—his
 locking system's too complex. Again, we never had this conversation.}
{127}{}{No importa. Gracias por la información.}
{128}{}{¿Como se supone que voy a hacerlo?}
{129}{}{[Max thinks hard for a moment.] Alright, listen. You look like someone I can trust. The door to Chad's house is
 locked using the most advanced non-electronic locking system there is -- this one's a real beauty. I should know, since I
 designed it. You see, before I was a caravan guard, I used to be a locksmith. Now, since I assume you'll be needing to
 get into that house, let me explain how to pick these types of locks.}
{130}{}{(About five minutes later Max is done explaining the workings of his locks.) There you go, that should be enough to get in there.
 With this information even a novice can pick one of those locks. You be careful now. Oh, and we never had this conversation.}
{131}{}{Guay. Gracias por la información.}
{200}{}{Has encontrado a Chad culpable de rozar el dinero de las caravanas.}
