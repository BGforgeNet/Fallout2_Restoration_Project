{100}{}{Ves un monitor de computadora.}
{101}{}{Ves al Padre Tully.}
{102}{}{Este chico se parece mucho a los otros chicos.}
{200}{}{¡Hola!}
{201}{}{Hola.}
{202}{}{Now, did I backup those computer files today...}
{203}{}{Lo siento, pero no tengo tiempo para hablar.}
{300}{}{¿Sí?}
{301}{}{Tenéis un montón de coches por aquí.}
{302}{}{¿Qué puedes contarme acerca de la Abadía?}
{303}{}{Háblame de tu líder.}
{304}{}{¿Tienes alguna información de un GECK?}
{305}{}{¿Sabes dónde puedo encontrar el Refugio 13?}
{306}{}{Adiós.}
{307}{}{Necesito alguna información específica.}
{308}{}{¿Como cuales?}
{400}{}{Yes, we have. Too many, in my opinion. I can't express to you the tedium of having to back up all these files
 each and every day. There's just so much information to preserve, but, of course, it must be done.}
{401}{}{Por supuesto. De todos modos, tengo algunas otras preguntas.}
{402}{}{We are an independent community. Anyone is welcome as long as they behave themselves.}
{403}{}{Vale.}
{404}{}{The Abbot is a good spiritual leader, but he's been a little cranky since we lost Brother Thomas to the beast.}
{405}{}{¿Qué tipo de bestia?}
{406}{}{I haven't seen it, personally--there's nothing in the world that could get me to go down there and explore those
 caverns--but if I had to guess, I'd say it's probably just some overgrown radscorpion.}
{407}{}{Si tú no lo has visto, ¿por que crees que es un escorpione rad?}
{408}{}{Because I've heard sounds echoing up from the caves--the sounds of snapping claws and skittering legs.}
{409}{}{Eso es.}
{410}{}{In fact, we do. Take a look on that computer over there. Here, you can use this card to access our encrypted files. [He hands you an access card.]}
{411}{}{Caray, ¡muchas gracias!}
{412}{}{I don't know anything about Vault 13, but there is Vault City down south. Maybe they have the info you need.}
{413}{}{Gracias.}
{414}{}{That computer near me should have the information you seek, but you'd need an access card to use it.
 We're very selective with who we give access to, but if you speak to the Abbot, perhaps he'll grant you permission.}
{415}{}{De acuerdo, gracias.}
{420}{}{I'm guessing you've read a lot of books in your time. So I'm curious, what's the most fascinating thing you could tell me?}
{421}{}{Hmm, let's see. Did you know a notch in a tree will remain the same distance from the ground as the tree grows?}
{422}{}{Claro. Si encuentro tantas, seguro que me pasaré por aquí.}
{423}{}{Vaaaale. Tengo otras preguntas.}
{424}{}{Si pudieras, te lo agradecería.}
{425}{}{No hay problema. Verás, tenía algunas otras preguntas…}
{426}{}{Gracias. Hasta otra.}
{430}{}{Tengo información que podría interesarte.}
{431}{}{Really?! That's great. Please, do tell immediately.}
{432}{}{Fascinating! I shall take this holodisk and add it to the computer database immediately. I appreciate you
 taking the time to find this for me. Thank you for collecting this for me.}
{433}{}{Well you see...Understanding habitat destruction and species extinction is dependent on an accurate and complete catalog of plant systematics and taxonomy. And then this means that...}
{434}{}{Ninguna de las dos. Aunque tengo otras preguntas.}
{435}{}{Gracias, Smitty. Sin problema. Nos vemos.}
{436}{}{Fascinating! I appreciate you taking the time to find this for me. Please go and upload this information to our computers.}
{437}{}{Sin problemas, Bob. Te veo en un día.}
{500}{}{¡Deja de hacer eso!}
{550}{}{That computer near me should have some information about it. You now have access, so take a look for yourself.}
{600}{}{The Abbot gave me permission to access the computers here.}
{601}{}{Ah yes, I heard about what you did. Thanks for taking care of that situation. Here is the access key. (He hands you the key.) Enjoy!}
{602}{}{Gracias. Hasta otra.}
{650}{}{Greetings traveler! I am Brother Paul and I am in charge of the collection of information for the Abbey. What can I do for you?}
{651}{}{Eso espero yo también. Tengo algunas preguntas más.}
{652}{}{Nada. Ya nos veremos.}
{4210}{}{Uh, no, I can't say I knew that. That's...interesting.}
{4211}{}{And did you know a cucumber is 96% water?}
{4212}{}{Wow, 96%, huh? Fascinating. But, um, what's a cucumber?}
{4213}{}{I've never seen one, but I've read about them. [He looks around nervously and lowers his voice.] I know we're
 not supposed to actually study these books, but when I was transcribing a book on botany, I just couldn't help but get
 sucked into it. The world of plants is simply captivating. Perhaps, if, during your travels, you happen upon some botany
 information, you could bring it to me? I'd be most grateful. Of course, it'd have to be our secret.}
{4220}{}{No creo que quiera saber qué es lo que se cuece por aquí.}
{4221}{}{Oh, bueno. Sólo quería preguntar.}
{4222}{}{Déjame hacerte otra pregunta.}
