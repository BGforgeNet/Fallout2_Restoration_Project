{100}{}{Ves a un hombre apenas vestido.}
{101}{}{Ves a Kaga.}
{103}{}{Lleva pantalones y parece que viene de una tribu.}
{104}{}{¡Kaga debería haber sido El Elegido!}
{105}{}{Cómo se atreve Arroyo a desterrarme de la tribu.}
{106}{}{¡Kaga se vengará de ti!}
{107}{}{Kaga te enviará al otro mundo.}
{108}{}{¡Volverás a ver a Kaga!}
{109}{}{¡Kaga nunca ha sido derrotado!}
{110}{}{Kaga se dedicará en cuerpo y alma a buscar tu destrucción.}
{150}{}{[A tall and powerfully built warrior stands before you, his eyes blaze with hatred as he looks you over.] So, they cast out Kaga, then deem YOU the Chosen One? Ha! You think being the grandchild of the Vault Dweller makes you special?! You think you are better than I, Kaga the Great?!}
{151}{}{Bueno, soy el Elegido.}
{152}{}{Hey now, hold on a second. I never said I was better than you.}
{160}{}{That title will mean nothing when Kaga rips the head from your shoulders!}
{161}{}{No words can save your hide. With your death, Kaga's honor shall be restored. Kaga will now take his vengeance!}
{200}{}{¿No mientes?}
{201}{}{What!? They picked *you* to be the Chosen One? Oh my, they've become desperate.}
{202}{}{No gusta. No hago.}
{203}{}{Kaga won't even bother speaking with you further. Prepare to die at the hands of Kaga!}
