{100}{}{Ves a un habitante de La Guarida.}
{101}{}{Ves a Klint.}
{102}{}{Her eyes are different colors. One of them brown as malmbrick, the other bright green.}
{103}{}{Ves a un hombre pelirrojo con un brillo esperanzado en los ojos.}
{104}{}{She has a soft face and entrancing eyes.}
{150}{}{Quererlo es bueno.}
{200}{}{Before you lies an open tank with icy cold water slowly being drained through a long, serpentine pipe. Inside, a
 woman, naked from head to toe, lies gasping and shivering. Looking around quickly, you snatch a bundle of loose clothing
 from a nearby locker and drape them over her for warmth.}
{201}{}{Whoa. That had to be some trip. Are you alright?}
{202}{}{Y-yes, the p-p-preservator r-restored my b-body t-t-temperature.}
{203}{}{Not all of it, it looks like. }
{204}{}{[You give it some time for her teeth to stop chattering. She recovers much quicker than you expect her to
 and looks up at you with sudden gravity.] Is... it over?}
{205}{}{¿Es así?}
{206}{}{¿Tu y quién más?}
{207}{}{The War. All those nukes.}
{208}{}{Eh, sí.}
{209}{}{That war ended long ago. Finished about as soon as it started.}
{210}{}{[She brushes wet strands of hair from her eyes. You notice one eye is brown while the other is emerald green.] Who won?}
{211}{}{Ninguna.}
{212}{}{[She looks at you blankly. She's very easy on the eyes, especially for someone who was just thawed out of a block of ice.]}
{213}{}{When 90% of the world is scorched to a crispy brown, I'd say it's hard to declare a clear winner.
 I mean, there wasn't much left worth winning.}
{214}{}{What... what date is it? What year? Is it still 2077?}
{215}{}{Hell, no. [You show her the date on your Pip Boy's calendar.]}
{216}{}{[She stares at the flickering screen, frozen in time like she never left the tank.]}
{217}{}{¿Estás casado?}
{218}{}{My God. I don't believe it. I was in that thing for over a century?!}
{219}{}{Seems like it. Hey, listen, don't look at me like that. I had nothing to do with putting you in there. Hell,
 my grandpa wasn't even alive back then. I just stumbled upon the location of this place and decided to check it out.}
{220}{}{Well, will you help me up, or would like it better if I continued sitting naked at your feet?}
{221}{}{I was just about to. [You help her to her feet.]}
{222}{}{¿Por qué creaste el Jet?}
{223}{}{Por nada.}
{224}{}{I have this terrible habit of touching everything I encounter. One thing led to another.}
{225}{}{¿Cómo llegaste aquí en principio?}
{226}{}{Es lo que quería.}
{227}{}{Then if you hadn't come along, I would've been stuck in that thing even longer. Maybe forever.
 (She pulls one of the shirts you wrapped her in over her head.) What's it like now, the world out there?
 You said 90% of it was destroyed?}
{228}{}{My world is a wasteland where every day is a struggle for survival. Most people have taken shelter in the ruined remains of the old ones.
 Others, like my tribe, attempt to forge a simple existence in the harsh wilderness. Truth told, it could be centuries before it even comes close to recovering.}
{229}{}{It can't possibly be as bad as it sounds. [She doesn't sound like she's convinced of one word she just said.]}
{230}{}{It's nothing like America in 2077, that's for sure.}
{231}{}{[She pulls a pair of pants on.] So, what now?}
{232}{}{We never did properly introduce ourselves. My name's }
{233}{}{Hola. ¿Cuál es tu signo?}
{234}{}{A los Shi.}
{235}{}{Eh, forastero, ¿qué estás haciendo por aquí?}
{236}{}{I don't know for sure. They knew the War was about to happen, so they put me in a preservator like the others.}
{237}{}{¿Tienes bloqueadores de endorfinas?}
{238}{}{From what I know, it's a branch of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. I was in Arizona when the
 War happened. I was taken here immediately.}
{239}{}{You must have been pretty important for them to want to preserve you. Were you a Chosen One, like me?}
{240}{}{Uh, not exactly. I was a homemaker, married to a councilman. Before that I wrote for several different news publications. It wasn't what you'd call a terribly exciting life.}
{241}{}{¿Qué le sucedió a tu pierna?}
{242}{}{I don't know. Probably one of the billions of casualties. I doubt any of my family made it through the war. My God, even if they did, it's been so long... everyone I ever knew is dead. [She bites her lip and her eyes start to shimmer with tears, but she quickly wipes them away and sighs, bringing herself under control.]}
{245}{}{Well, since you're giving me a choice... (smirk)}
{246}{}{Te está mirando malhumorada.}
{247}{}{Oh, I mean, of course I'll help you up. [You help her to her feet.]}
{250}{}{¿Y ahora qué vas a hacer?}
{251}{}{I don't know. What do you do when you've been hibernating for over a century? Even bears don't sleep that long.
 The world out there isn't the world I knew. I don't know if I could stand to see what it's turned into.}
{252}{}{I know it's a wasteland out there, but you've still got a whole life to live. You're wasting it down here.
 Come with me and maybe we can make something of it.}
{253}{}{It doesn't look like you've got much of a choice. You can either sit down here and rot, or you could come with me. It's up to you.}
{260}{}{You know, you're right. I could go back to being frozen and sleep it off for another hundred years, but that
 would be the cheap way out. I need to see for myself what the world's become, and play a part in putting it back together.}
{261}{}{Come on then. Let's go grab a brahmin steak first thing.}
{262}{}{No me hagas hacerte esto.}
{270}{}{Forget it. It's been this way for over a hundred years. What makes you think we're going to fix it now?}
{271}{}{Si cambias de idea házmelo saber.}
{272}{}{Maybe. But don't count on that happening. I should just go back to sleep for another century or so.}
{280}{}{What if these machines stopped functioning though? You'd be dead and you'd never know
 whether the world that blew itself up ever put itself back together.}
{281}{}{Then I'll watch what happens to it from wherever I am.}
{282}{}{How do you know for sure you're gonna be taken someplace special after you sleep the big sleep? I come from a
 tribe that believes in the afterlife and prophecies, but from a pragmatic standpoint we're all just a bunch of organic
 machines that think and talk and feel because of flesh and chemical components. What if there's nothing after you die -- we
 shut down like computers -- and this is all you've got?}
{283}{}{I'd rather take my chances in cryogenic suspension than wander that wasteland.}
{284}{}{No hueles tan mal.}
{285}{}{[Kitsune ponders your words for a good long while. Finally, she lines her eyes with yours.] I can't pretend you don't have a point. Maybe... maybe I will take my chances with you.}
{286}{}{Let's get out of here, then. It's time we left this dump behind.}
{287}{}{Actually, I think I'm going to strike out on my own. I've always been the independent type, so it shouldn't be any skin off my back. A lot has changed since I've been away and I'd like to see it for myself. Thanks for unthawing me. You take care of yourself.}
{288}{}{[HECHO]}
{300}{}{¿Sí?}
{301}{}{Estoy escuchando.}
{302}{}{¿Querías algo?}
{303}{}{¿Qué pasa? ¡Sabes que tengo mucho que hacer!}
{304}{}{¿Qué te ocurre?}
{305}{}{¿Hay algo que necesites de mí?}
{310}{}{Kitsune, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have been frozen in a cryo tank for no good reason.
 I'm interested in knowing what it was exactly you did before you were put on ice.}
{311}{}{¿Por qué te importa? Es en el pasado.}
{312}{}{Estamos en el camino juntos. Quiero saber más sobre ti.}
{313}{}{[Sighs.] Well, I suppose there's no need for secrecy anymore. It's just hard to break a life-long habit. You see, I was pretty much born a spy.}
{314}{}{My father was Chinese, but he and his family were no friends of the Chinese government. He was born in Beijing but got the most important aspect of his education here, in the States. When he returned home and got a job as a public servant, he'd already been recruited by the Americans as an intelligence agent.}
{315}{}{I'm not overly familiar with the politics of your time, but I think I follow what you're saying: Your dad was Chinese, but he was secretly a spy for the Americans. So did the Chinese ever suspect him?}
{316}{}{My father worked at the Ministry of Agriculture for thirty-eight years.}
{317}{}{Uh, alright, I guess that's a "no". So when did you enter the picture?}
{318}{}{Well, one day, an aide to the official my father was working for caught him making copies of secret documents.}
{319}{}{Eso no puede ser nada bueno...}
{320}{}{Actually, it didn't turn out so bad. You see, she thought along the same lines as my father, and within a couple of months, they were married.}
{321}{}{Some guys have all the luck, huh?}
{322}{}{They had me a year later. I was raised in China under the facade of a patriot. In school I'd write about how China was strongest when unified, and how we had to continue to strive toward social equality. 
 When I was older I wrote for nationalist newspapers and participated in debates supporting the ruling party.}
{323}{}{Wow, most of that went way over my head. But if I understand correctly, you're saying you and your parents deceived the Chinese into thinking you were loyal.}
{324}{}{Your parents took great pains to make sure your family's true loyalties stayed secret.}
{325}{}{All warfare is based on deception. My parents loved their country. They just hated the people who ran it and thought it would be better off as a democracy. The way they saw it, they weren't betraying China - they were working against a government they didn't believe was good for it.}
{326}{}{Sigue.}
{327}{}{I married an official who worked for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense. I chose him because he was the most willing to talk about his work when we were together. So I played the role of the dutiful wife, while secretly reporting relevant information back to my American superiors. But then things got complicated.}
{328}{}{¿Cómo es eso?}
{329}{}{My father was contacted by Dr. Raynard Muldrake, an old colleague he had worked with during his time in the States. Dr. Muldrake urgently requested a private meeting, but my father was in poor health at the time and was in no condition to travel to America. Dr. Muldrake agreed to meet me in his place.}
{330}{}{¿Y qué pasó?}
{331}{}{It turned out Muldrake was part of a top secret project at a West Tek research facility in Southern California. The project had started off innocently enough, as an attempt to find a way to make people immune to the New Plague, but it quickly evolved into something more sinister. Something called Forced Evolutionary Virus, or FEV.}
{332}{}{Sigue.}
{333}{}{It had the potential to greatly enhance a person's strength and intellect, but the FEV was dangerously unstable. Despite this, the military hoped to use it to create an army of super soldiers that could crush the Chinese.}
{334}{}{Dr. Muldrake was against the change in the project's direction, but kept his mouth shut out of fear for his life. But when he learned that the military was testing the virus on unsuspecting, small American towns, he knew he had to take action. The world needed to know the truth.}
{335}{}{Así que eso es cuando ha contactado a tu padre...}
{336}{}{Right. When I met him, he gave me a holodisk containing classified documentation of the FEV project. That put me in a rather difficult position: I could release the information contained in the holodisk and betray the country I'd sworn my loyalty to, or I could destroy the disk and bury the ugly truth from the people.}
{337}{}{Mierda. No me digas...}
{338}{}{I sent copies of the holodisk to just about every major news outlet in the world. It pretty much destroyed whatever sympathy the American government still had. I might have revealed the truth to the world, but I'm afraid I also set in motion its destruction... Things escalated quickly, and eight months later, the bombs were dropped.}
{339}{}{Y en todo caso, ¿cómo has entrado aquí?}
{340}{}{The American government was hunting for the person responsible for leaking the information. They finally caught up with me just before the end. They were already preparing to freeze me when the sirens first sounded. Probably to preserve me in case I had any more secrets I hadn't told them.}
{341}{}{¿Has dicho }
{342}{}{It doesn't matter now. Everyone's dead...}
{345}{}{¿Tienes alguna idea de lo que está causando la reducción de los envíos?}
{346}{}{What I *may* have brought about. The world would've blown itself up sooner or later, anyhow. It was only a matter of time.}
{347}{}{Maybe you should refrain from sharing this little tidbit of information with anyone else.}
{348}{}{Apuesto a que tú te bañas.}
{350}{}{I know what you must be thinking, but you can't blame yourself for something like that.}
{351}{}{It's always easier not to accept responsibility.}
{352}{}{You couldn't have known. Besides, there were other conflicts between the "powers". They would've blown each other
 up sooner or later. It was only a matter of time.}
{353}{}{¡Los Khans son los más fuertes!}
{354}{}{No huele tan mal.}
{355}{}{Nature's been trying to wipe us out for millennia. All these new diseases, natural disasters. We were some kind
 of evolutionary mistake. Maybe we came about too early or weren't suppose to come about at all. We've done more damage
 to this planet than any thing living or dead.}
{356}{}{But we can atone for it. That's the special thing about us.}
{357}{}{You've got an awfully nice way of putting it. Thanks for hearing me out. I almost feel like I can move on.}
{360}{}{Say, since you were a spy, I'm sure you're pretty skilled at stealth and all that. Anything you can teach me?}
{361}{}{Yes, I've had a quite a bit of practice with sneaking, lockpicking, and stealing. Here, let me show you a few things
 they don't teach you in the books.}
{362}{}{You've got it now. Remember, practice makes perfect.}
{363}{}{Creo que ya es hora de que te vayas.}
{370}{}{Acerca de esos saqueadores...}
{371}{}{¿Qué pasa con ellos?}
{372}{}{They're different colors.}
{373}{}{What's the term for it... heterochromia? Is that what you have?}
{374}{}{Mine isn't a natural condition. The one on the left didn't belong to me. I lost the old one in an accident.
 And I've never learned to appreciate that until now.}
{375}{}{¿Qué quieres decir?}
{376}{}{Ever since the transplant I always felt like I was seeing the past in one eye and the present in the other.
 More so than ever now. And that helps me carry on.}
{377}{}{Realmente tengo que irme.}
{410}{}{¿Qué quieres saber?}
{411}{}{I have a black belt in sanshou. I can stab a man to death if the situation calls for it. Pistols, rifles and the like I'm decent with.}
{420}{}{Tenemos que hablar sobre la distancia entre nosotros.}
{421}{}{¿Qué te pasa en los ojos?}
{422}{}{Quedarse cerca de mí.}
{423}{}{De acuerdo. Volveré.}
{424}{}{No te alejes demasiado.}
{425}{}{Necesitas algo espacio, entiendo.}
{426}{}{Salgamos.}
{427}{}{Okay. We're harder targets apart.}
{430}{}{No tome demasiado tempo o me voy sin ti.}
{431}{}{Voy a jugar al solitario o algo hasta que vuelvas.}
{432}{}{Estoy seguro de que encontraré algo que hacer mientras estás fuera.}
{440}{}{Siempre que me necesitas.}
{441}{}{Glad you're back. I held auditions but I couldn't find a good replacement for you.}
{442}{}{¿Extrañas a mi compañía?}
{443}{}{Feeling guilty about taking off without me?}
{444}{}{Estoy empezando a pensar que no estabas planeado regresar.}
{445}{}{About time. In Ancient China, tardiness would get you hanged, drawn and quartered.}
{446}{}{Oye. Estaba pensando en ti ahora.}
{450}{}{You sure took your time doing whatever it is you were doing without me.}
{451}{}{Es bueno estar en el camino de nuevo.}
{452}{}{¿Por qué?}
{453}{}{¿Hacia dónde nos dirigimos entonces?}
{454}{}{Como la seda, señor.}
{460}{}{You've got enough people already. You don't need an entourage.}
{461}{}{Maybe when you've freed up some space. I don't run well with crowds.}
{462}{}{¿Estás listo para llevarme contigo?}
{463}{}{Vamos.}
{464}{}{No, aún no.}
{470}{}{Jesus, you look like the Grim Reaper. You ought to get yourself checked out.}
{480}{}{No hay problema. Aunque tengo una o dos preguntas.}
{490}{}{Nunca ha sido mejor. Vamos.}
{491}{}{Los he recibido peores practicando.}
{492}{}{I'm not that bad off. Just some flesh wounds.}
{493}{}{I'm not doing so great. More blood than I care to have coming out of me.}
{494}{}{. Házme saber si puedo ayudarte con lo que sea.}
{495}{}{Can't go on any longer... leave me behind or get me to a doctor. Fast.}
{500}{}{If you insist. I can still take a man's head off with my hands.}
{1000}{}{No puedo creer que estés actuando así.}
{1010}{}{Not my kind of place to be born in, no offense.}
{1020}{}{This looks like some 15th Century emperor's burial tomb.}
{1030}{}{This place smells like cattle dung all over.}
{1040}{}{I don't think it'd be wise to head into this place without the proper footwear.}
{1050}{}{I've seen worse places, believe me. Not that I'm too fond of this one.}
{1060}{}{Inténtalo. Me encantaría.}
{1070}{}{Este lugar parece peor que Ciudad Refugio.}
{1080}{}{Me encanta el olor a radiación por la mañana.}
{1090}{}{¿Crees que con eso voy a rebajar mis precios?}

{1110}{}{¿Por qué una rata gigante parlante está tan preocupada acerca de todo esto?}

{1170}{}{Me duele todo.}
{1171}{}{No me sorprendería.}

{1273}{}{Hundreds bucks to anyone who dares to go skinny-dipping in those waters.}
{1280}{}{No puedo hacer nada con esto.}
{1281}{}{This place smells bad and if I could see it better it'd probably look even worse.}
{1282}{}{Careful. There's probably something ugly and smelly holed up here.}
{1283}{}{¿Esas tetas son de verdad? ¿Puedo asegurarme?}
{1284}{}{¿Y ahora qué vamos a hacer?}
{1285}{}{Mejor seguir viviendo para luchar otro día.}
{1290}{}{War... a whole lot of good that did us.}
{1291}{}{No deber encontrarnos.}
{1292}{}{I used to live someplace just like this...}
{2001}{}{¿Por qué estás aquí si tanto odias el lugar?}
{2002}{}{I could use a soak in a hot spring. Wonder if there're any of those left anymore.}
{2003}{}{I'd kill to find someone to play mahjong with.}

{2052}{}{No, Myron. I wouldn't sleep with you if you built me a time machine.}
