{100}{}{Ves a un guardia de aspecto severo.}
{101}{}{Ves el robot de reparación y mantenimiento del reactor.}
{102}{}{Hologram 10031. He is in charge of all the ground maintenance at the EPA.}
{200}{}{Hello there. Mind if I ask how you managed to get in here? The elevators to the surface broke down a long time ago.}
{201}{}{Let's see... I used a rope to climb down an elevator shaft to the utility level... Then I crawled through a fan duct and found myself in a robot maintenance area...}
{210}{}{I'm surprised you made it past all those damn plants without being eaten. I'm Hologram 10031, the Director of Ground Maintenance here at the EPA. [He sighs heavily.] I know, I know, the grounds look terrible. No need to tell me.}
{211}{}{If you're not happy with the way the grounds look, why don't you do something about it?}
{212}{}{No kidding. The grounds are littered with radioactive goo, corpses, mutant carnivorous plants... Seriously, you must be the worst groundskeeper ever.}
{220}{}{If I could do something about it, trust me, I would. I've got no physical body, and the damn robots won't respond to a word I say. I've been operating at 100% inefficiency for the last few decades -- how pathetic is that? The other Holograms won't let me forget it either. The only one more useless than me is the Director of Operations.}
{221}{}{Quizá pueda ayudarte.}
{222}{}{Gracias por el dinero. Ahora tengo que irme.}
{230}{}{Hey, if you're really willing to help, that'd be great. I'll ensure you get something for your troubles.}
{231}{}{Hola. ¿En qué puedo ayudarte?}
{232}{}{Lo siento, ahora mismo no tengo tiempo.}
{240}{}{Those mutated spore plants have spread beyond the confines of the green house and have taken root all over the EPA's grounds. If you could get rid of all those bastards for me, that'd be a big step in the right direction.}
{241}{}{Sure, I could kill all the spore plants for you. I'll be back once it's done.}
{242}{}{Lo siento, pensé que los había matado a todos.}
{250}{}{Hola de nuevo. ¿Qué puedo hacer por ti?}
{251}{}{Hola. Pareces desanimada. ¿Qué sucede?}
{260}{}{Hello again. Have you reconsidered helping me? As I mentioned before, I'll make it worthwhile for you.}
{261}{}{¿No tienes nada mejor que hacer?}
{262}{}{Olvídalo. Volveré en algún otro momento.}
{270}{}{¿Has completado tu misión?}
{271}{}{Yep, I've killed all the plants. The grounds still look like hell, but at least they're a little safer.}
{272}{}{Aún no. Me pondré en contacto cuando lo haya hecho.}
{280}{}{Oh, thank you so much. For that, I hereby hire you as my assistant groundskeeper. [He points to a key on the floor by his feet.] I managed to coax one of the half working robots into bringing that for you. You now have authorization to access the storage shed. Thanks again.}
{281}{}{[You pick up the key and pocket it.] No problem. See ya.}
{290}{}{You look rather messy. Is everything all right?}
{291}{}{Yeah, I'm fine. I had some trouble with some mutated plants on the way down here but I took care of them.}
{300}{}{You have? Wonderful! For that, I hereby hire you as my assistant groundskeeper. [He points to a key on the floor by his feet.] I managed to coax one of the half working robots into bringing the keys to me awhile ago -- just in case. Take 'em. You now have authorization to access the storage shed. Thanks again.}
{301}{}{No te preocupes por eso.}
{302}{}{No, gracias. Adiós.}
{310}{}{Hey, you've done me a good turn so you'll take the key and anything you want or need. It's my way of saying thank you for what you've done.}
{311}{}{Oh, all right then. Say who are you anyway? Why is it so important to you that I've killed all of these plants?}
{320}{}{I'm the Director for Ground Maintenance. I ensure that the grounds are in good order, but as I'm a Hologram and can't do anything myself, I command the robots to do it all for me. As most of them have stopped working, I've operated at 100% inefficiency for the last few years. You've helped me more than you could ever imagine.}
{321}{}{Bien, yo, eh, tengo que irme. Adiós.}
{330}{}{Bien. Sigue con tu trabajo.}
{331}{}{I'm now operating at 1% efficiency!}
{332}{}{You wipe out the mutant plants that have grown rampant over the EPA's grounds.}
{333}{}{The whole place has been taken over by these mutant plants.}
{334}{}{¡Shhhh! Están por todas partes...}
{335}{}{Entonces aquí están los 500 dólares. Gracias.}
{336}{}{Los restos de una ballena.}
{337}{}{Si tan solo los Ciudadanos le dejasen marchar...}
{338}{}{Lo sé. Lo siento.}
{339}{}{I thoroughly apologize for the state of the grounds.}
{340}{}{Sabes algo al respecto, ¿verdad?}
{341}{}{Maybe 10001 is right. Maybe we should just destroy it all.}
