{100}{}{Ves a Bill el mercader.}
{101}{}{Ves a un hombre de aspecto malvado.}
{200}{}{Hola, viajero. Nombre es Bill. ¿Qué puedo hacer por ti?}
{201}{}{Bienvenido de nuevo. ¿Quieres algo más?}
{202}{}{Vamos a comerciar.}
{203}{}{Me preguntaba si es usted con quien debería hablar para ponerme al día de los asuntos locales.}
{204}{}{No importa. Adiós.}
{210}{}{Say, I've noticed a lot of old equipment and items have been collected here at the Abbey.
 I don't suppose you've found anything...special, during your time here?}
{211}{}{Heh, so you noticed that, huh? Yeah, the Abbey folks have a bit of a fascination with anything pre-war,
 especially if it's tech related. They've formed some kind of kooky religion around it. I don't quite understand it,
 myself, but they're nice people and they pay good money for anything pre-war I manage to get my hands on. But anyway,
 as for something special...hmm, [He glances over at Marcus.] It's funny you should ask, I just might have something that
 would interest your friend here.}

 useful right now.}
{213}{}{Oh, bien. Déjame ver lo que tienes a la venta.}
{214}{}{Eso está bien. Deja que te pregunte algo más.}
{215}{}{¿Como cuales?}
{216}{}{You see, a caravan came through here not too long ago, claiming to have come up from the deep south. Said they'd
 been attacked by some of them vile mutants (turning to Marcus) no offense, big guy. Anyway, they did a lot of bragging
 about how they'd wasted all the muties. Claimed there'd been nearly a dozen of 'em, and I called bullshit. But it turns
 out they had some proof.}
{217}{}{¿En serio? ¿Qué fue eso?}
{218}{}{A hulking set of mutant armor they'd managed to salvage off one of the corpses. Of course, for all I know, they
 stole it off the bones of some long dead mutie they'd stumbled upon in the wastes, but who knows? Anyway, they weren't
 eager to keep lugging the heavy thing around, so they offered it to me for dirt cheap. I didn't know what I'd ever do
 with it, but I figured a deals a deal.}
{219}{}{Well, I'm sure Marcus here could benefit from this. How much for it?}
{220}{}{That's interesting. Well, Marcus here is tough enough. I don't think we'll be needing that item. Let me ask you
 something else.}
{221}{}{Well, this bad boy could easily be melted down to make three or four sets of metal armor. Let's say $3000.}
{222}{}{Tengo suficiente para eso.}
{223}{}{Ahora mismo no la quiero. Déjeme preguntarle otra cosa.}
{224}{}{Alright then. This is going to take two of us to move this thing, so let me help you fit it to your friend here.}
{225}{}{[HECHO]}
{226}{}{Hey, this fits nicely!}
{300}{}{¿Qué querías saber?}
{301}{}{¿Cómo consigues la energía?}
{302}{}{¿Dónde están los caravaneros?}
{303}{}{Pensándolo mejor, cuenta conmigo. Adiós.}
{304}{}{I get a new shipment of supplies twice a month. Frankly, I wish they'd come more often, but we're only on a
 minor trade route so I guess this is the best we can get.}
{305}{}{I'm not quite sure. Usually, the ones that stop by here are pretty well equipped and not really interested in
 hanging around very long. But if you're looking to hook up with one of em, I'd head over to Redding or even down to NCR.
 They've got pretty active caravans and good help is always wanted.}
{306}{}{Interesante. Tenía curiosidad por algo más.}
{307}{}{Gracias. Vamos a comerciar.}
{308}{}{Bien, gracias por la información. Nos vemos.}
{400}{}{¿Conseguiste todo lo que necesitabas?}
{401}{}{La verdad, me gustaría echar otro vistazo a tu mercancía si no es molestia.}
{402}{}{Sí, lo hice. Hasta luego.}
