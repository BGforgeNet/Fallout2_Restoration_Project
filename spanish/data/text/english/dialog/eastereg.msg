{100}{}{Ves MIBoba Fe88.}
{101}{}{Ves a un cazarrecompensas duro y despiadado.}
{110}{}{You see a tough, ruthless bounty hunter. He doesn't look like he talks much. He helped with the new scripts and ideas. And with killing people.}
{200}{}{Ves a Hivan Zolo.}
{201}{}{A scruffy lookin', but handsome rogue.}
{210}{}{Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything.
 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side. I can tell when a guy is handy
 with a gun, so take this. Trust me: it'll come in handy when you've got a price on your head. (He hands you a blaster.)}
{211}{}{Mi verdadero nombre es Ivan Zaharath.}
{212}{}{I translated the RP into Polski for the benefit of the great and powerful Republic of Poland ... I mean Rebel Alliance.}
{213}{}{Laugh it up, fuzzball.}
{214}{}{Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.}
{215}{}{Who're you callin' 'scruffy lookin'!?}
{300}{}{Ves a Contie-bacca.}
{301}{}{Parece como una alfombra.}
{310}{}{Roow rooo arrrrr rooow.}
{311}{}{Rrrrrrrrrrrrr .... squeak!}
{312}{}{Nowrrrrragh.}
{313}{}{Yawrrrk!}
{314}{}{Roow rooo Nowrrrrragh!}
{315}{}{He says he's Continuum, and he made new & unique graphics.}
{316}{}{He says he made them using 3D modeling. He's quite clever you know. For a human.}
{317}{}{He says he's not speaking Czech-speak, though it does sound a bit like baby-talk.}
{318}{}{He says it's not a crossbow, it's a blaster. And no you can't have it.}
{319}{}{Dice que deberías darle las gracias por traer el submarino al juego nuevamente.}
{400}{}{Ves a Darek Vader.}
{401}{}{This guy looks hard as hell and appears to be more machine than man.}
{410}{}{I'm Darek. I helped answer a million noob questions for Obi-Wan-Killap.}
{411}{}{Join me! Together we can rule the galaxy!}
{412}{}{Did you know that the great Obi-Wan-Killap asked ME for help?}
{413}{}{Don't tell Obi-Wan-Killap, but I think he might be losing his mind.}
{414}{}{I helped squash several nasty bugs. You can thank me later.}
{500}{}{Ves a Jotisz el Hutt.}
{501}{}{This guy is big, fat and green.}
{510}{}{I'm Jotisz the Hutt. I may look like a big fat green slug, but I actually helped create those nice new armored threads your buddy Sulik is wearing.
 Those were created by Yosan12 and me. I know! And with these stubby hands!}
{511}{}{I'm Jotisz the Hutt. I may look like a big fat green slug, but I actually helped create those nice new armored threads your buddy...hey where
 is Sulik? You should go get him and see how he looks. His threads were created by Yosan12 and me. I know! And with these stubby hands!}
{512}{}{*whistles* I'm a big fat green slug...}
{513}{}{En caso de que no lo hayas notado, estoy sospechosamente fácil de estrangular.}
{514}{}{¿Ahora, dónde habré puesto Leia...?}
{600}{}{Ves a R2Qwerty.}
{601}{}{A feisty little robot. He flashes and beeps.}
{610}{}{¡Bip bip!}
{611}{}{Rrrrrr beep Rrrrwow!}
{612}{}{*flashes and jiggles excitedly*}
{613}{}{Crossbows! Tactics! Crossbows!}
{700}{}{Ves a Chris3ParksO.}
{701}{}{A shiny gold humanoid robot. He looks surprised.}
{710}{}{Hi, I'm Chris3ParksO, human-cyborg relations. I am well versed in over 3 million programming languages.}
{711}{}{I helped lay the groundwork for the Umbra Tribe and the EPA.}
{712}{}{This is R2QWERTY: my faithful sidekick. He created new critters and graphics.}
{800}{}{Ves a Yosan12.}
{801}{}{A little green guy. He looks OLD.}
{810}{}{Yosan12 am I. Created the NPC armor mod I did. Lift Xwing from swamp did I too. Talk in strange very also way do I.
 Difficult to understand, hmmm? Hagh Hah ha! Also, created the new Sniper, Wakizashi and lightsaber animations I did. }
{811}{}{Remember: anger, fear, hatred: of the dark side are they.}
{812}{}{When gone am I, a little fuzzy glowing ghost will I become.}
{813}{}{Once, a puppet with wisdom and character was I. Now, a hollow, CGI character for the kids I have become.}
{814}{}{Stupid JarJar Binks is.}
{900}{}{Ves a Obi-Wan-Killap.}
{901}{}{He seems like a kindly old man with something slightly bear-like about him.}
{910}{}{Saludos, }
{911}{}{. I see you've been doing quite well for yourself. I'm Obi-Wan-Killap: I make Fallout work like it should have from the very beginning.}
{912}{}{Wow. Well, thank you for that, Mr. Killap. How did you do it?}
{913}{}{¿Qué demonios es Fallout?}
{914}{}{Ok. And who, pray tell, are these other people?}
{920}{}{I am a Programming Master, skilled in the way of The Source. It is an energy field created by all digital things. It surrounds us and penetrates us.
 It binds the galaxy together. You, me - the tree - the rock. Pixilated beings are we....not this crude matter *pokes you*.
 I have learned to use this power through years of staring at a computer screen.}
{921}{}{Wow. Our shaman always said there was more to this world than what I can see, hear, touch, taste and feel. Can you teach me to use the power of The Source?}
{922}{}{I think I've heard enough religious mumbo-jumbo to keep me stocked for another nuclear winter. Frankly, I prefer a plasma pistol at my side.}
{923}{}{Oh, genial, otro fanático religioso. Me largo de aquí.}
{930}{}{Fallout is the world you are in. I created it, or at least, made it work like it was supposed to. You see, not
 long ago, this world was in chaos. Travelers that came here were often killed by the huge number of bugs that roamed
 the wasteland corrupting saved games indiscriminately. The gods of this world had been careless. But then I came, and,
 using the power of The Source, my friends and I cleaned up the wasteland. You could say I am the savior. I am seen by
 many as a hero: The Bear Dude.}
{931}{}{I see. Well, actually, I was under the impression I was the hero of this story. I run around looting shit and killing people - you know - heroically. Oh, and I talk to them sometimes, but that part can get tiresome.
 I just click through it to get to the fun bit.}
{932}{}{Great work, Mr. Killap. I really appreciate all your time and hard work spent cleaning up the wasteland. If what you say is true, then you should know that I, too, am a hero. In fact, I've squashed quite a few bugs myself.}
{935}{}{And we are grateful that you have destroyed the Enclave. You are the true hero here.}
{936}{}{Lo que tu digas.}
{937}{}{¿Y ahora qué es lo que quieres?}
{938}{}{¿Quién es esa gente?}
{940}{}{These are my companions. They helped me improve this world: MIBoba Fe88, Hivan Zolo, Contie-bacca, Darek Vader, Jotisz the Hutt,
 R2Qwerty, Chris3ParksO, Yosan12, Empress Timeslip, Luke Skynet, Mon-Morticia, Kanhef, HawkEyE, Adam Dravean, Mr. Wolna, encinodude,
 Minigun Jim, Bofast, Pixote, Mash, Mikael Grizzly, x'il, Per, and the Masses. They all helped in the great project to restore
 this world from the bug infestation. The only good bug is a dead bug.}
{941}{}{Hmm. those names somehow sound familiar... Well, I think I'll go talk to them.}
{950}{}{Indeed I can. You must learn to use your feelings: let go of your conscious mind. Turn off the monitor. Close your eyes, and FEEL The Source flowing through the mouse ... (Follow his instructions.)}
{951}{}{You lack the experience to start training. Return to me when you've at least learned some basic Programming, young padawan.}
{960}{}{Como quieras, joven }
{961}{}{. But before you go on your way, remember this: Many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. Now go, and may The Source be with you.}
{962}{}{. Your actions on your quest have proved you good, kind and honest. Take this to aid you in your struggle against the Dark Side: it is your ancestor's light saber. This is the weapon of a Java Knight.
 Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. And though you may be tempted to use it to arbitrarily cut people in half for entertainment, you should use it only in service of good.
 Good luck, and may The Source be with you, my friend.}
{963}{}{What?! My ancestor, The Vault Dweller, had one of these?! I don't remember finding this in Fallout 1! *run off to check*}
{964}{}{Thank you, Mr. Bear Dude. For everything. May The Source be with you too.}
{1000}{}{Ves a Emperatriz Timeslip.}
{1001}{}{Ves a una figura envuelta de aspecto cruel con un enconvarse.}
{1010}{}{I'm Empress Timeslip. I'm a Programming Master, skilled in the way of The Source. It was I who allowed Obi-Wan-Killap's spies to steal my
 engine fixes to greatly improve the stability of this world, and correct FOOLISH AND STUPID MISTAKES left by the original ones.}
{1011}{}{Indeed, my master. Tell me about yourself oh great one.}
{1012}{}{Wow. You're creepy. And your face looks awful.}
{1013}{}{Eso está bien. Tengo que ir.}
{1020}{}{I can change that which is hardcoded into The Source with the merest thought, and determine the fate of entire universes!
 An entire legion of my best bug fixes await you in the rest of your adventure. I'm master of the Dark side of The Source.}
{1021}{}{Silence! Years of working in the dark may have distorted my looks, but in this mind are the powers of a God! Using The Source I create weather, mastered entire worlds and tweak that which cannot be tweaked!
 It was I who allowed the Evil Beth to rule the RPG world with my mods. Everything that has transpired has done so according to MY desires.}
{1022}{}{Sauce? What kind of sauce? Are you saying cooking is the key to controlling the universe?. Whatever you say, chef.}
{1023}{}{Yeah yeah. Jeeze, whatever you say. I think I will leave now.}
{1024}{}{Uh, ok. that's great. Well, I need to go..erm ...water my plants...}
{1030}{}{Ignorant fool. Your overconfidence is your weakness, and my faith in your friends is ... er ... mine. *looks confused* Be gone from my sight!}
{1040}{}{Wait! You will leave IF and WHEN I decide. In case you haven't noticed, you have been exceedingly evil in your quest.
 Your hate has made you powerful and your character has developed according to my desires. Anger, fear, hatred ... of the dark side are they.
 Now you will become my apprentice and fulfill your place AT MY SIDE!}
{1041}{}{Como te deseo, mi amo. A tus órdenes.}
{1042}{}{No estoy interesado. Adiós.}
{1045}{}{Go forth and wreak havoc my child.}
{1046}{}{¡Vete!}
{1050}{}{Eeeeeeexcellent. Then take this Java weapon. Use it. Kill indiscriminately. USE YOUR AGRRESSIVE FEELINGS, CHILD! (He hands you a red lightsaber.)}
{1051}{}{So.... basically carry on as I've been doing. No problem. Bye!}
{1052}{}{No te fallaré, mi amo.}
{1053}{}{¿Has matado a todos? Quieres decir que... ¿incluso a los niños?}
{1060}{}{ESPECIALLY the children.}
{1100}{}{Ves a Luke Skynet.}
{1101}{}{A hooded figure who looks quietly confident.}
{1110}{}{Soy Luke Skynet. Estoy aquí para rescatarte.}
{1111}{}{¿Rescatarme?}
{1112}{}{¿Parezco una princesa? ¿Qué quieres decir con "rescatarte"?}
{1113}{}{Right. I think you're the one that needs rescuing, pal...from your own movie career. Bye.}
{1120}{}{Yes, I'm here to rescue you. I created the basis to what you see at the Abbey, and there you will find salvation. There you will find the light!}
{1121}{}{I've actually already been there. I 'rescued' a lot stuff from getting lost in all those drawers and containers.}
{1122}{}{Amen brother. Thank you for aiding in the creation of that place of peace and solace. And just when I needed to rest my radiated feet and seek spiritual rejuvenation.}
{1123}{}{I remember that place. No qualified shaman though, and no herb-superb. I don't know who's idea of a spiritual center that is, but it's not mine.}
{1124}{}{¿Oh? ¿Y dónde está este lugar que puede rescatarme?}
{1125}{}{Cuck-oo! Bye bye now!}
{1130}{}{Deberías volver a jugar al juego con otro tipo de personaje.}
{1131}{}{Lamento escuchar eso. Gracias por tu tiempo. Adiós.}
{1132}{}{Well, I think YOU should go there Skybrain, and stay there. I'm outta here. Freak.}
{1135}{}{Here. (He shows you on your PipBoy). You should go there now.}
{1138}{}{La Abadía es un lugar de soledad.}
{1139}{}{Ten mucho cuidado de no darme.}
{1200}{}{Ves a Mon-Morticia.}
{1201}{}{Una señora parece muy diplomática.}
{1210}{}{I helped with writing a walkthrough to aid all the noobs on their new adventures in this improved world.}
{1211}{}{Shit! I'm on the wrong side! I never was quite sure who's side I was supposed to be on.}
{1212}{}{Does my bum look big in this?}
{1213}{}{Empress Timeslip has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. *wink*}
{1300}{}{Ves a Kanhef.}
{1301}{}{Ahora me parezco a Van Gogh.}
{1310}{}{I'm basically the NMA helpdesk.}
{1311}{}{No estoy con estos raros.}
{1312}{}{Damn. Why is the no. 23 always late?}
{1313}{}{In case you didn't know, I'm just an all-round useful guy.}
{1400}{}{Ves a HawkEyE.}
{1401}{}{A glittering gem of hatred.}
{1410}{}{Bonjour. Je suis Hawk-Eye. J'ai translate le version Francais. }
{1411}{}{I'm Hawk-EyE. I headed the translation of the French version. Vive la France!!}
{1412}{}{I like to eat .... little fishies so sweeeet!}
{1413}{}{No le importamos a nadie.}
{1500}{}{Ves a Adam Dravean.}
{1501}{}{Gracias por las indicaciones.}
{1510}{}{I'm Mr. Wolna. I headed the translation of the German version.}
{1511}{}{[plz bitch-slap me!!]}
{1512}{}{Good work, guys! Keep it up!}
{1513}{}{¡Mira! ¡Un águila de oro!}
{1514}{}{Ich komme aus Deutschland!}
{1600}{}{Ves al señor Wolna.}
{1601}{}{This guy is seriously enthusiastic...}
{1610}{}{[He removes his helmet and casts aside his crimson cloak, revealing a ruggedly handsome man with a shaved head and a leather jacket. He seems to exude charisma and awesomeness.] Hey stranger, the name's Adam. How's it going?}
{1611}{}{Pretty good. It's been a rocky road, but I've finally come to the end.}
{1612}{}{No tengo tiempo para esto. Adiós.}
{1620}{}{That's good to hear. [He looks around, then furrows his brow.] Where's Dex? I spent a lot of time writing that dude's dialogue, and you're not even using him? [He sighs heavily and shakes his head.]}
{1621}{}{¿Dex? ¿Escribió su diálogo? ¿De qué habla?}
{1630}{}{That's good to hear. Excuse me a moment. [He walks over to Dex, gives him a high five, then returns to you.] I'm glad to see you and my man Dex have stuck together. You know I spent a lot of time writing that dude's dialogue.}
{1631}{}{¿Como saber Dex? ¿Y tú "escribiste su diálogo"? ¿De qué estás hablando?}
{1640}{}{Look, don't worry about it. But if you ever decide to embark on another epic quest, make sure to stop by the EPA. There's a shitload of things to do there and if you play your cards right, you might find yourself a new companion. [He looks you over and grins.] Yeah, you're just Dex's type, so you'll be friends for sure.}
{1641}{}{Gracias. Lo tendré presente.}
{1650}{}{Look, don't worry about it. But if you ever decide to embark on another epic quest, make sure to stop by the EPA. There's a shitload of things to do there and if you play your cards right, you might find yourself a new companion. [He looks you over.] You'll probably have to change your attitude if you want to make friends with Dex. He likes his companions to be a bit more ... morally impaired.}
{1651}{}{Gracias. Lo tendré presente.}
{1660}{}{[He nods and looks off into the distance.] You know, Dex wasn't my only contribution. I also helped the Bear Dude in sprucing this world up by serving as adviser, tester, and guardian of canon and original intent. But mostly, I was tasked with bringing all the new wasteland speech up to par. It's been a hell of a long road, but if you ask me, this thing turned out pretty fuckin' sweet. [He looks back at you and grins.]}
{1661}{}{Como sea. Estoy cansado de escuchar esto. Adiós.}
{1662}{}{That's quite noble of you. You've done a remarkable job. Take care of yourself. Bye.}
{1670}{}{*Looks over at your party members* Lookin' good, Dex.}
{1671}{}{Keep your eye on Dex, alright? I don't want him getting into trouble. After all, he's my creation.}
{1672}{}{Eres bienvenido para limpiar el diálogo del Yermo.}
{1673}{}{Hey, where's Dex? Did I mention I'm his creator?}
{1700}{}{Ves a encinodude.}
{1701}{}{Parece como un buen tipo.}
{1710}{}{*Looks over at your party members* Lookin' good Kitsune.}
{1711}{}{You keep an eye on Kitsune, you hear. I don't want her getting into trouble. She's my creation, you know.}
{1712}{}{Me ayudó con el submarino, ya sabes.}
{1713}{}{Hey, where's Kitsune? I wrote her dialogue you know.}
{1714}{}{Me ayudó con el submarino, ya sabes.}
{1800}{}{Ves a Minigun Jim.}
{1801}{}{La vida es justa y segura al amparo de su ley.}
{1810}{}{*Looks over at your party members* Lookin' good Cat.}
{1811}{}{You keep an eye on Cat, you hear. I don't want him getting into trouble. He's my creation, you know.}
{1812}{}{Hey, where's Cat? I wrote his dialogue you know.}
{1900}{}{Ves a Bofast.}
{1901}{}{Se levanta cuando ve que lo está mirando.}
{1910}{}{Good going bringing a peaceful end to the Raiders attacking Vault City. I helped make that possible.}
{1911}{}{You didn't have to kill all those Raiders attacking Vault City. There is a peaceful solution now, thanks to me.}
{2000}{}{Ves a Pixote.}
{2001}{}{Ves a un bot noble de reparación.}
{2010}{}{[The robot nods as you approach.] Hello there. Are you enjoying your time in this world?}
{2011}{}{Sí. Gracias por preguntar.}
{2012}{}{Realmente no. Las cosas podrían ser mejores.}
{2013}{}{Ahora no estoy de humor para charlar. Adiós.}
{2020}{}{That's great to hear! I hope all the hard work I have done to make each location appear as unique and detailed as possible is in some way responsible for your happiness. It took a lot of work to tidy things up, but the overall atmosphere and appearance is top notch now. Don't you agree?}
{2021}{}{Oh, definitely. Everything looks amazing. You're quite talented!}
{2022}{}{Eh, está bien.}
{2023}{}{Eso está bien. Adiós.}
{2030}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. Perhaps you haven't taken a good look at the world around you. I have done much
 to make each location appear as unique and detailed as possible. Maybe if you look at the details, this will lift your
 spirits. It took a lot of work to tidy things up, but the overall atmosphere and appearance is top notch now.
 Don't you agree?}
{2031}{}{Ahora que lo mencionas, me di cuenta de que las cosas se ven mucho más agradables ahora.}
{2032}{}{En realidad no me di cuenta.}
{2033}{}{Eso está bien. Adiós.}
{2040}{}{[The robot rocks back and forth with glee.] I'm glad you like it. Well, I must be going now. I've got more goodies
 to unleash upon this world.}
{2041}{}{De acuerdo. Ten cuidado.}
{2050}{}{[The robot's head lowers in sadness.] Well, my work isn't for everyone I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me,
 I must be going. I've got more goodies to unleash upon this world.}
{2051}{}{Lo que sea. Adiós.}
{2060}{}{I so enjoy creating new things.}
{2061}{}{So many new details now. So beautiful.}
{2100}{}{Ves a Mash.}
{2101}{}{Él asiente con la cabeza.}
{2110}{}{Greetings! Glad you've made it this far. I hope you are enjoying the expanded visible size of this world. Not enough
 of this world could be shown at any one time. I changed all this though. Empress Timeslip and I are masters of the
 Source. He and I have brought this old world into a new era.}
{2111}{}{Wow, thanks for that. Everything is a lot better. Sometimes a bit too small, but I can easily adjust that.}
{2112}{}{No tengo tiempo para esto. Adiós.}
{2120}{}{I'm glad you are enjoying my hard work. I also made it possible to change appearances. No longer are you stuck
 with a specific race or hair type. Yosan12, x'il, and others made the physical appearances themselves, but I, with the
 help of Empress Timeslip, dug deep into the Source to make it all possible. I see that you have taken advantage of this
 new ability. Outstanding!}
{2121}{}{Oh, I love my new looks. Thanks for that!}
{2122}{}{De acuerdo. Adiós.}
{2130}{}{I'm glad you are enjoying my hard work. I also made it possible to change appearances. No longer are you stuck
 with a specific race or hair type. Yosan12, x'il, and others made the physical appearances themselves, but I, with the
 help of Empress Timeslip, dug deep into the Source to make it all possible. I see that you have not taken advantage of
 this feature. Just know that it is there and available. A great place to test it out is at the EPA. Oh, what fun!}
{2131}{}{Lo tendré en mente. Gracias.}
{2132}{}{De acuerdo. Adiós.}
{2140}{}{Excelente. Bien, ten cuidado.}
{2141}{}{Adiós.}
{2142}{}{Nos vemos.}
{2150}{}{The Source is tricky, but I can handle it.}
{2151}{}{Enjoy the expanded visibility of this world!}
{2152}{}{¡Disfruta el nuevo tú!}
{2200}{}{Ves a Mikael Grizzly.}
{2201}{}{Este animal es muy peludo.}
{2210}{}{Hello there. I helped bring the submarine back into this world.}
{2211}{}{You like how furry I am? I know I do.}
{2212}{}{Espero que te guste el submarino.}
{2300}{}{Ves a x'il.}
{2301}{}{Te mira con admiración.}
{2310}{}{I helped a lot with critter appearances. Hope you have enjoyed it!}
{2311}{}{Nice hair, man. I helped make that possible.}
{2400}{}{Ves un montón de rocas.}
{2401}{}{Hay una placa en las rocas.}
{2410}{}{There is a plaque on the pile of rocks. It reads: "Dedicated to Per Jorner. Master of the walkthroughs,
 King of the lizards, and Accumulator of all rocks.}
{2500}{}{Ves una gran masa de goo.}
{2501}{}{This mass of goo seems to spell out something: "Dedicated to all those whose names have been forgotten, but
 yet helped make everything possible."}
{2510}{}{}
{5000}{}{Aquí no se permiten el combate.}
