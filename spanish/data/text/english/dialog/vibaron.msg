{100}{}{Ves a un caravanero.}
{101}{}{Ves a Tyler, el líder de esta banda.}
{200}{}{Hello Traveler, name's Robert Baron, master of this here caravan. Are you looking to make a trade?}
{201}{}{Hmm, veamos qué es lo que tienes.}
{202}{}{Quería hablar contigo otra vez.}
{203}{}{Ya veo. Bueno, seguiré mi camino.}
{204}{}{Robert Baron, huh? Ever think about going by Bobby Baron? That's got a nice bounce to it, don't you think?}
{210}{}{I think your mom might've bounced you on your head a couple times. Now, do you want to trade, or not? I'm a busy man.}
{220}{}{De acuerdo. ¿Algo más?}
{221}{}{Yes actually, I wanted to speak with you on behalf of a nearby village.}
{222}{}{Ya veo. Bueno, seguiré mi camino.}
{230}{}{[He furrows his brow.] Village? Not sure what your--oh! Are you talking about that rat infested little shit-hole down the way?}
{231}{}{Sí, tal vez.}
{232}{}{Sí, lo soy.}
{233}{}{It's not a shit-hole. They're a struggling community that's making some real progress.}
{240}{}{Look, I already met with them, and I'm going to tell you the same thing I told them. They're simply too small for me to bother with. Besides, that place is fetid as all hell.}
{241}{}{De acuerdo. Necesito preguntar algo más.}
{242}{}{Oh, come on, it's not that far out of your way. You pretty much pass right by it.}
{243}{}{¿No hay forma de que pudiera ver a Myron?}
{250}{}{Now what? If you're not going to trade, then stop wasting my fucking time.}
{251}{}{Vamos a hacer negocios.}
{252}{}{Lo siento, tengo que irme.}
{253}{}{Creo que te mataré lentamente.}
{254}{}{Is there *any* way I could get you to change your mind about trading with the village?}
{260}{}{So what if I do? I don't care if it's only a *minute* out of my way, it's just not worth the hassle.}
{261}{}{De acuerdo. Necesito preguntar algo más.}
{262}{}{¿No hay forma de que pudiera ver a Myron?}
{263}{}{That's too bad, because a smart merchant would jump on this opportunity. But hey, if you're not interested, I suppose I'll have to go elsewhere...}
{270}{}{Now just hold on a moment. I didn't say for certain that I wasn't interested. What's this opportunity you speak of?}
{271}{}{You see, that village might not be much to look at now, but I've got some insider information that all but guarantees that place is going to be the new hot spot. Trust me, it's going to be booming in the coming years. So if I were you, I'd want to build up relations now, before they get too big and you miss your chance.}
{280}{}{Haha! You expect me to believe that shit-hole is going to turn into something worthwhile? I think I'm about done wasting my time with you.}
{281}{}{De acuerdo. Necesito preguntar algo más.}
{282}{}{¿No hay forma de que pudiera ver a Myron?}
{290}{}{You're not kidding, are you? Hmm, I suppose it couldn't hurt to take a little detour over there now and then. Hell, it's hardly even out of my way. Thanks for the tip, friend.}
{291}{}{No hay problema. Adiós.}
{292}{}{Sí. Adiós.}
{300}{}{[He seems to consider your question.] Perhaps . . . exactly what are we talking here?}
{301}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll pay you $500.}
{302}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll do my part to ensure nothing "unfortunate" happens to your caravan.}
{303}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll show you a good time you'll never forget.}
{304}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, my wife here will show you a good time you'll never forget.}
{305}{}{No importa, en realidad. Gracias de todos modos.}
{310}{}{Now you're speaking my language! Alright, it's a deal. [He greedily snatches the money from you and shakes your hand.]}
{311}{}{Gracias. Es un placer hacer negocios contigo.}
{312}{}{Adiós.}
{320}{}{¿1.000 fichas? ¿Estás de broma? Que sean 1.500 y cerramos el trato.}
{321}{}{Todavía no tengo tanto. Adiós.}
{322}{}{De acuerdo, venid a por mí.}
{323}{}{No. Adiós. }
{330}{}{Now you're speaking my language! You've got yourself a deal. [He greedily snatches the money from you and shakes your hand.]}
{331}{}{Gracias. Es un placer hacer negocios contigo.}
{332}{}{Adiós.}
{340}{}{Are you threatening me? No one threatens me and lives! (to his caravan guards) Kill this stupid fuck!}
{341}{}{¡Que vengan!}
{350}{}{Look, I don't want any trouble. If you want me to swing by and trade with that village, fine, no big deal. Hell, it's hardly even out of my way. No problem.}
{351}{}{I'm glad we have an understanding. I'll be watching you. Bye.}
{352}{}{You better hope there's not a problem. Cause if there is, I'll solve it. Bye.}
{353}{}{[Glare at him intently for a moment, then slowly walk away.]}
{360}{}{Ugh! God no! I'd rather fuck a brahmin. Now get out of here and stop wasting my time.}
{361}{}{Que te jodan, ¡gilipollas!}
{362}{}{Fine, but you could've just said no. No need to be a jerk about it.}
{363}{}{No sé de que estás hablando.}
{364}{}{[Bury your ugly face in your hands and run away crying.]}
{370}{}{Eh, sorry girl. I'm just not in the mood right now. You got anything else to offer?}
{371}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll pay you $500.}
{372}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll do my part to ensure nothing "unfortunate" happens to your caravan.}
{373}{}{Pues no. Adiós.}
{380}{}{[He looks you up and down, then grins.] I think you've got yourself a deal. Do you take it in the backdoor?}
{381}{}{¿Conque es así como quieres jugar?}
{382}{}{¡Ya tienes lo que querías!}
{383}{}{Ugh! Hell no! Now let's hurry up and get this over with before I puke.}
{390}{}{[The merchant grins at you as he refastens his belt.] Holy shit, you sure know how to drive a good bargain. If you ever need to talk a merchant into doing something else, you make sure and look me up. Now, I should really be going. It was a pleasure doing business with you.}
{391}{}{[Shudder.] Once was enough. Bye.}
{392}{}{Bien. Adiós.}
{393}{}{Adiós.}
{400}{}{[He looks Miria up and down, then grins.] I think you've got yourself a deal. [He shakes your hand, then puts his arm around Miria and walks her to someplace more private.]}
{401}{}{[Tap your foot while you wait.]}
{402}{}{::Silba mientras trabajas…::}
{403}{}{Mantén tus manos apartadas de tu arma mientras estés aquí.}
{404}{}{[Stand there silently and make awkward eye contact with the caravan guards while you listen to the sounds of your wife being defiled by the merchant master.]}
{410}{}{[An hour later, you see Robert Baron and Miria, now sweaty and disheveled from their sexual romp, walking back towards you. You notice Miria is walking with a slight limp. The merchant grins at you as he refastens his belt.] Holy shit, you sure know how to drive a good bargain. If you ever need to talk a merchant into doing something else, you make sure and look me up. Now, I should really be going. It was a pleasure doing business with you.}
{411}{}{Lo que sea. Adiós.}
{412}{}{Bien. Adiós.}
{413}{}{Adiós.}
{500}{}{You convince the merchant to add the village to his trade route.}
{510}{}{You kill the merchant, thus ensuring that the village won't be able to trade.}
