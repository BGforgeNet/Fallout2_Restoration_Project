{100}{}{Ves al guardián del cementerio del monasterio.}
{101}{}{Ves al hermano Samuel, el guardián del cementerio.}
{102}{}{He looks drunk and a bit drowsy.}
{200}{}{*hickup* Why, 'ello there, my name's Samuel. What, uh, *hickup* brings you here?}
{201}{}{*hipo* Hola de nuevo.}
{202}{}{Solo voy a echar un vistazo. No quiero molestar.}
{203}{}{¿Conoces algún otro Refugio?}
{204}{}{Father Tully, you say? [He appears to be racking his brain trying to remember.] Yeah...I *hickup* 'member Tully.
 How's that fella doin anyway? I 'aven't seen him since he was kicked out of 'ere long time *hiccup* long time ago.
 [He grins drunkenly as he reflects.] Boy he was a hoot. Him and me together, *hickup* what a combo.}
{205}{}{He lives in New Reno now, preachin' the good word, er, something like that. You know, you two seem a lot alike.}
{206}{}{New Reno, huh? [He leans on his shovel, pulls out a small flask and takes a big swig.] I 'member him sayin he'd
 *hickup* be headin that way. I'm glad he made it there safely. I always *hickup* liked that fella. A real hoot. If you
 see him again, tell him Ol' Sammy is still alive an' kickin.}
{207}{}{Lo haré. Aunque tengo algunas preguntas más.}
{208}{}{Lo haré. Cuídate, Sam.}
{209}{}{No importa. Lamento molestarte.}
{210}{}{Actually I was just going to say that he sends his greetings. I'll be sure to tell him you say hello as well. I got some other questions though.}
{211}{}{Actually I was just going to say that he sends his greetings. I'll be sure to tell him you say hello as well. Take care Sam.}
{300}{}{¿Qué quieres *hipo* saber?}
{301}{}{¿Eres el guardián del cementerio?}
{302}{}{¿Qué puedes contarme acerca de la Abadía?}
{303}{}{¿Puedo ayudarle en algo?}
{400}{}{Yes, *hickup* I tend to these 'ere graves. Nobody else wants to *hickup* do it, so Ol' Sammy got th' job. It's
 not as bad as one might think. It's got its… perks, if you know what I mean. [He grins sloppily and wiggles his bushy
 eyebrows at you.]}
{401}{}{Sé a lo que te refieres. Puedo dejarlo cuando quiera. Pero no hoy.}
{402}{}{Ahora mismo no la quiero. Déjeme preguntarle otra cosa.}
{403}{}{No. No sé a lo que quires decir, pero tengo curiosidad mórbida...}
{404}{}{Hell yeah I do. Nothing turns me on like a rotten cadaver.}
{410}{}{Why, I get to be outdoors, and no one's 'round to tell Ol' Sammy when he's had enough. I *know* when I've
 'ad enough... when 'ere's none left! [He cackles, which quickly turns into a hideous cough. After coughing up a lung
 or two, he smiles at you.]}
{411}{}{Eh, *por supuesto* eso es lo que quería decir. [Suspiro de alivio]. Sin embargo, permíteme preguntarte otra cosa.}
{420}{}{[His eyes go wide with shock and he seems to instantly sober.] That's not what I meant, you...you MONSTER! FIEND!
 Get away from me! }
{421}{}{Whatever, you drunk old fuck. You don't know what you're missing.}
{430}{}{Foul demon! Be gone!}
{500}{}{The Abbey, well, this place *hickup* has been my 'ome fer most of my life. Everone 'ere *hickup* is nice, and
 anyone's welcome, long as they *hickup* don't cause trouble. I, myself, don't spend too much time in th'
 mona-*hickup*-monastery, but I know our 'puters have all kinds of info that's been collected over th' years. Maybe
 some of it *hickup* might be of some use to you.}
{501}{}{You don't spend much time in the church? You are a monk, aren't you?}
{502}{}{[He grins, revealing a gap filled set of rotten teeth.] Well, *hickup* let's just say that th' other monks don't
 take *hickup* too kindly to my, uh, drinking habits.}
{503}{}{Tiene sentido, supongo. Tengo algunas preguntas más.}
{504}{}{Supongo que sí. Ya nos veremos, Sammy.}
{505}{}{Ya veo. Mira, debo irme.}
{600}{}{Hmm... *hickup* lemme...lemme tink a minute. Yeah, I might got somethin, if yer up to it.}
{601}{}{Eh, olvídelo, Sam. Debo irme ahora.}
{602}{}{Claro, Sam, qué necesitas?}
{603}{}{Well, th' past coupla days I've *hickup* noticed some of these graves are bein dug up. Now, whoever's doin this
 don't appear to be gettin that far, but it's a *hickup* a pain fer me to fill 'em back up.}
{604}{}{Hmm, well did you try and figure out who has been doing this?}
{605}{}{Sure *hickup* I tried. One night I stayed around till midnight or so and no one showed up. I must've fallen asleep
 soon afterwards. Too much drinking I s'pose. [He grins, pulls out his flask and takes a hefty swig.] So, what do you
 *hickup* say? You wanna help out?}
{606}{}{Bien, veré lo que puedo hacer. Permíteme preguntarte otra cosa.}
{607}{}{Well, now that you mention it, I do *hickup* 'member Mr. Peterson sayin something about hearing some noises comin
 from his field. He might know something about this. He and that pretty little wife a his live right over there.
 [He points to the building south of the graveyard.]}
{608}{}{Veré lo que puedo hacer.}
{609}{}{Creo que voy a pasar. Debo irme.}
{700}{}{He cuidado de la situación de excavación de las tumbas. No deberíais tener más problemas aquí.}
{701}{}{Well, that's *hickup* good news. Glad I won't be falling into any more open *hickup* graves. Thanks fer th' help.}
{702}{}{Encantado de ayudar. Aunque tengo algunas preguntas.}
{703}{}{Bueno, cuídate, entonces.}
{704}{}{I don't think open graves are the real reason you're falling down Samuel, but you take it easy now.}
{1000}{}{*Silbas*}
{1001}{}{*Cof* *Cof*}
{1002}{}{*Clears throat*}
{1003}{}{*Cof*}
{1004}{}{*Suspiro*}
{1005}{}{*Hickup*}
{2000}{}{Ha sido un *hipo* largo día. Vuelve por l'mañana.}
