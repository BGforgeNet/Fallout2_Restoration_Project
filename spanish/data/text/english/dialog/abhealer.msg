{100}{}{Ves a Jack, el farmacéutico de la Abadía.}
{101}{}{Tiene una cruz roja en el hombro.}
{200}{}{Si estás herido, habla conmigo.}
{300}{}{¿Cómo puedo ayudarte?}
{301}{}{Estoy herido, ¿puedes ayudarme?}
{302}{}{[Babeas].}
{303}{}{Entonces, ¿qué haces aquí en la Abadía?}
{304}{}{Adiós.}
{400}{}{¡Se acabó!}
{401}{}{Gracias.}
{402}{}{¡Deja de hacer eso!}
{403}{}{[GO ON]}
{404}{}{[LEAVE]}
{405}{}{STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT!}
{406}{}{[GO ON]}
{407}{}{[STOP]}
{408}{}{(Suddenly, Jack starts to melt.) I'M MELTING, I'M MELTING, OH WHAT A WORLD...}
{409}{}{¿Pero qué...?}
{500}{}{Hey, don't steal my medical supplies!}
{501}{}{You gain 200 experience points for making Jack melt. Are you happy now, you sick fuck?}
{600}{}{I'm a doctor. I've been tending to the people of this Abbey for about, oh, fifteen years now, I believe.}
{601}{}{I see. That's a lot of years to study all the pre-war medical books in the Abbey's library. You must be quite the doctor.}
{602}{}{¿De dónde conseguiste todo tu equipo médico?}
{603}{}{Interesante. Creo que debo irme ahora.}
{604}{}{[He frowns.] I fancy myself a fine doctor, but I can't credit the books for that since I'm not even allowed to...never mind, I won't get into that. My father was a doctor, and he passed his knowledge down to me.}
{605}{}{Ah, ya veo.}
{700}{}{Some of these meds I received from my father. Most of the rest were already here at the Abbey.}
{701}{}{Interesante, adiós.}
{702}{}{Do you think you could give me some of your meds? You seem to have plenty to spare.}
{703}{}{You want me to just *give* them to you? What makes you think you deserve them more than the people of the Abbey?}
{704}{}{Because I tend to get hurt...a lot.}
{705}{}{Because I'm on a holy quest to find a Garden Of Eden Creation Kit. You see, my entire village will perish if
 I don't find this device in time. Your people, on the other hand, seem to live a peaceful life without much need for so
 much healing equipment. I'm not asking for a lot, even the smallest amount you could give me would help me greatly.}
{706}{}{[He ponders over your words for a moment, then nods.] Alright, I'll give you some of our excess medical supplies.
 It sounds like you're gonna need 'em. Here. [He hands them to you.] Good luck, wanderer.}
{707}{}{Gracias, Jack. Eres un verdadero salvador del Yermo. Adiós.}
{708}{}{Then perhaps you should learn to be more careful. Sorry, I'm not going to just give away the Abbey's medical supplies.}
{709}{}{Bien. ADÍOS.}
{800}{}{No puedo hablar ahora.}
{801}{}{Lo siento. Estoy en la mitad de algo. Ven a verme más tarde.}
{802}{}{Hola de nuevo.}
