{100}{}{Ves a un guardia con ropas holgadas, con una expresión de aburrimiento cauteloso.}
{101}{}{Ves a un guardia con servoarmadura.}
{102}{}{Ves al guardia de la puerta.}
{150}{}{¡Oye! ¡Aléjate de aquí!}
{151}{}{No toques eso. Es tu último aviso.}
{152}{}{Te lo advertí. Hora de morir.}
{200}{}{¿Qué quieres ahora?}
{201}{}{Tú otra vez. ¿Qué quieres?}
{202}{}{¿Qué estás haciendo?}
{203}{}{Estoy aquí para ver al jefe.}
{204}{}{Nada. Adiós.}
{210}{}{No intentes nada raro.}
{211}{}{¿Es qué no tienes moral?}
{220}{}{Un paso atrás, extranjero.}
{221}{}{De acuerdo. Adiós.}
{222}{}{Nobody tells me what to do. You're fucking dead!}
{230}{}{And I need you to fuck right off. You're not permitted to use the motorboat, hell, you're a lao wai, not a Shi.}
{231}{}{Listen, I'm in a desperate situation. If you don't let me use that motorboat, then my entire tribe could die.
 Right now, they're in the clutches of those Enclave bastards and they're counting on me to save them. But in order to
 do that, I'm going to need to use that motorboat. If you won't let me use it, I'll have to take it by force and one of
 us will end up dead. Please, don't let it come to that.}
{232}{}{Actually, I'm an honorary member of the Shi. I was hired for the submarine maintenance team due to my expertise in...subology. Here's my password...}
{233}{}{No creo que te vaya a gustar esto.}
{234}{}{Muy bien, entonces. Me interesa otra cosa...}
{240}{}{[He stares at you for a long moment, then sighs.] Look, no one gets on this boat without giving the proper password. You know, like the one you just gave me. [Mumbles.] Ken Lee's going to have my head for this...}
{241}{}{Thank you, friend. And don't worry, I won't speak a word of this anyone.}
{250}{}{I hope not, for both our sakes... Let me know when you're ready to use the boat. You can't bring anyone with you, as it'll draw too much attention. You'll have to go at this alone.}
{251}{}{Voy a hacerlo ahora mismo.}
{252}{}{Ahora mismo no.}
{260}{}{[The guard listens to the password and nods.] I guess you really are a technician. Hmm, the Shi must be getting desperate to hire outsiders... Anyway, you're early. Didn't they tell you that the tech team doesn't leave port until midnight? You can wait for the rest of the team here, if you wish.}
{261}{}{¿No tienes nada mejor que hacer?}
{262}{}{Volveré más tarde.}
{270}{}{Just use the mooring post and slide down the rope to the boat. Don't take too long out there, though, I don't want to get into any trouble.}
{271}{}{Lo tengo. Adiós.}
{272}{}{Ya he oído bastante. Adiós.}
{280}{}{¿Quieres ir allí conmigo?}
{281}{}{Si, estoy listo. Vamos.}
{282}{}{No, aún no.}
{290}{}{Eh, ¿no ves que estoy ocupado?}
{300}{}{Me ride metal fishy-fish?}
{310}{}{[He looks at you as if you're dumbest creature he could possibly imagine. Slowly, he shakes his head.] You no ride
 metal fishy-fish. You go. You go, or I shoot. Understand?}
{311}{}{Bien, adiós.}
{312}{}{You meanie-man. Me smash meanie-man!}
{500}{}{You talk your way into gaining access to the motor boat.}
