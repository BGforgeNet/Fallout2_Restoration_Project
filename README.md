This is an update for [killap's Restoration Project](http://killap.net/) for Fallout 2. This is _not_ an independent mod, it should be installed on top of RP 2.3.3.

### Installation
1. Start with a clean humongous installation of the game.
1. Download and install [RP 2.3.3](http://killap.net/) normally.
1. Download the latest RPU [release](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project/releases/latest).
1. Extract the archive into the main game directory, overwriting files when asked. That's it.

**Notes:**
1. RPU does not _require_ starting a new game. However, if you continue with a save from an older version, you won't see some of the fixes in the areas that you've already visited.
1. If you made any changes to `ddraw.ini`, these changes will be lost when you overwrite that file. If you want to preserve them, make sure to make a backup copy and then transfer the settings manually to the new `ddraw.ini`.
1. [Party Orders](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/fallout2-party-orders) mod can be downloaded separately.
1. Most translations are incomplete, they are provided as is. **You** can [help with completion](https://tra.bgforge.net/projects/fallout/rp/). Some details are [here](docs/translations.md).

### Reporting issues
If you've found an issue:

1. Make sure it's in RP's content. Vanilla bugs should be reported to [UP](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch). Bugs in other mods - to the corresponding authors.
1. Keep in mind that RP's scope is only to restore cut content. Not to add "nice to to have" things.
1. Check [known issues](docs/known.md).
1. Follow the [instruction](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch/blob/master/docs/REPORTING.md).
