## Fallout 2 Restoration Project

This is an update for killap's Fallout 2 Restoration Project 2.3.3. It is not an independent mod, it installs on top of RP.

### Reporting bugs
If you've found an issue:

1. Make sure it's in RP's content. Vanilla bugs should be reported to [UP](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch). Bugs in other mods - to the corresponding authors.
1. Keep in mind that RP's scope is only to restore cut content. Not to add "nice to to have" things.
1. Check [known issues](docs/KNOWN.md).
1. Before opening a new github issue, check existing ones (both open and closed). Maybe it's already been reported.
1. Next, depending on the problem type:
    * **Typo**. Attach a screenshot, explain what's wrong in the wording and how it should be corrected. (Screenshot key is F12).
    * **Quest bug**. Explain the problem. Attach **two** savegames: one where the problem can be seen right away, another one _right before_ starting the quest. Indicate if any other mods are installed, and their versions.
    * **Crash**. See [reporting crashes](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch/docs/CRASH.md).
    * **Something else**. Use your best judgement. Provide as much into as possible.

**Additional notes:**
- The best way to get the issue fixed is to submit a pull request.
- One issue per problem.
- Attach the files directly on Github, don't use external file sharing sites.
- Some bugs may be better illustrated with a gif or a video, you can do that.
